The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinicopathologic characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to evaluate the biological behavior of this disease. We investigated the association between smoking-related COPD, the recurrence-free proportion (RFP) and the clinicopathological features of clinical stage I NSCLC patients.
