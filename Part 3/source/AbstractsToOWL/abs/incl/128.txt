This technical note describes a new microfluidic sensor that combines low-cost (USD $0.97) with rapid fabrication and user-friendly, fast, sensitive, and accurate quantification of a breast cancer biomarker. The electrodes consisted of cost-effective bare stainless-steel capillaries, whose mass production is already well-established. These capillaries were used as received, without any surface modification. Microfluidic chips containing electrical double-layer capillary capacitors (μEDLC) were obtained by a cleanroom-free prototyping that allows the fabrication of dozens to hundreds of chips in 1 h. This sensor provided the successful quantification of CA 15-3, a biomarker protein for breast cancer, in serum samples from cancer patients. Antibody-anchored magnetic beads were utilized for immunocapture of the marker, and then, water was added to dilute the protein. Next, the CA 15-3 detection (<2 min) was made without using redox probes, antibody on electrode (sandwich immunoassay), or signal amplification strategies. In addition, the capacitance tests eliminated external pumping systems and precise volumetric sampling steps, as well as presented low sample volume (5 μL) and high sensitivity using bare capillaries in a new design for double-layer capacitors. The achieved limit-of-detection (92.0 μU mL
