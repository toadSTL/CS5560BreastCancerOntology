Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Even after diagnosis, the prognosis cannot be concluded since patients can develop resistance to therapy, which favors tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. In e recent years, research has focused on identifying significant markers that can be used to determine the prognosis. Melatonin can act through G protein-coupled MT1 receptor, which controls selected protein kinases, influences the levels of transcription factor phosphorylation, specific genes expression, proliferation, angiogenesis, cell differentiation, migration, and indirectly controls the transport of glucose in cancer cells. It is known that glucose enters the cells by glucose transporters, such as GLUT1 which shows wide tissue distribution and appears to be altered in human breast carcinoma. High GLUT1 expression is associated with increased malignant potential, invasiveness and poor prognosis in some cancers including breast cancer.
