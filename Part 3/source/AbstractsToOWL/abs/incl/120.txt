The current study was to evaluate soluble ST-2 level and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin or trastuzumab treatment for 6 months and determine whether soluble ST-2 level can be used to predictive left ventricular function impairment.Patients who were diagnosed as having breast cancer receiving doxorubicin or trastuzumab or combined therapy were enrolled. Demographic data, prior medical history and related medical therapy, and site and stage of breast cancer information were collected from electronic health record. Fasting blood was used to detect soluble ST-2 and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels before and after 6 months doxorubicin or trastuzumab therapy. Echocardiography was performed before and after 6 months of doxorubicin or trastuzumab therapy.Participants were divided into 3 groups based on tertiary soluble ST-2 level. Compared with 1st tertiary group, patients in the 3rd tertiary group had higher proportion receiving combined therapy (14.3% vs 4.7%, P < .05). Baseline soluble ST-2 level was similar across groups. After 6 months' therapy, soluble ST-2 level was significantly higher in the 3rd tertiary group. Pearson correlation analysis showed that soluble ST-2 level was positively correlated with left ventricular volume and E/e' ratio while negatively correlated with LVEF. Doxorubicin, trastuzumab, combined therapy, soluble ST-2 level, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment were all independently associated with LVEF change.In breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin or trastuzumab therapy, soluble ST-2 level can be used to predict cardiac function and structure changes.
