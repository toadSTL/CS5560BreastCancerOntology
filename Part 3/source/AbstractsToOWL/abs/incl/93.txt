The ultrasound-guided diffuse optical tomography is a noninvasive imaging technique for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The technique uses a handheld probe capable of providing measurements of multiple wavelengths in a few seconds. These measurements are used to estimate optical absorptions of lesions and calculate the total hemoglobin concentration. Any measurement errors caused by low signal to noise ratio data and/or movements during data acquisition would reduce the accuracy of reconstructed total hemoglobin concentration. In this article, we introduce an automated preprocessing method that combines data collected from multiple sets of lesion measurements of 4 optical wavelengths to detect and correct outliers in the perturbation. Two new measures of correlation between each pair of wavelength measurements and a wavelength consistency index of all reconstructed absorption maps are introduced. For phantom and patients' data without evidence of measurement errors, the correlation coefficient between each pair of wavelength measurements was above 0.6. However, for patients with measurement errors, the correlation coefficient was much lower. After applying the correction method to 18 patients' data with measurement errors, the correlation has improved and the wavelength consistency index is in the same range as the cases without wavelength-dependent measurement errors. The results show an improvement in classification of malignant and benign lesions.
