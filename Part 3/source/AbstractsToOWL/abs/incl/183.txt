Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy CT for the preoperative diagnosis of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in participants with breast cancer. Materials and Methods For this prospective study, dual-phase contrast agent-enhanced CT was performed in female participants with breast cancer from June 2015 to December 2017. Quantitative dual-energy CT parameters and morphologic parameters were compared between metastatic and nonmetastatic SLNs. The quantitative parameters were fitted to univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The diagnostic role of morphologic and quantitative parameters was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves and compared by using the McNemar test. Results This study included 193 female participants (mean age, 47.6 years ± 10.1; age range, 22-79 years). Quantitative dual-energy CT parameters including slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve (λ
