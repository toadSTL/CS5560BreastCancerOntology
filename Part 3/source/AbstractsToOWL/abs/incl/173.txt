Recent studies suggest that vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), a 180-KDa homodimeric glycoprotein, may be associated with cancer-related events including tumor cell migration, motility, invasion, or metastasis. Therefore, this study applies VAP-1 immunohistochemical staining to demonstrate the invasiveness component of the breast cancer. The VAP-1 staining results were compared in 148 breast cancer cases to identify possible correlations with clinical status, including age, tumor size, tumor grade, TNM stage, lymphatic invasion, metastasis, recurrence, and survival rate. Immunohistochemical staining results showed VAP-1 negative or weak staining in normal ducts and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but these phenotypes were positively associated with a stiffened VAP-1 that presented at the invasive front of the lesion. Our data demonstrated that VAP-1 expression was positively associated with lymphatic invasion, distant metastasis, and patient survival in breast carcinoma. Notably, VAP-1 expression was found to be significantly correlated with the overall survival (p < 0.0001). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that VAP-1 expression was a significant independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in breast carcinoma (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, this study suggests that VAP-1 is linked to progression of tumor invasion and metastasis in breast carcinoma. VAP-1 is shown to be a biomarker that can be predict invasive potential and clinical outcome in breast cancer.
