Objective: To gauge surgical outcome in breast cancer patients with particular reference to overall survival andrecurrence free survival among breast cancer patients in Hospital Sultanah Nora Ismail Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia.Methods: Patients undergoing ablative breast cancer surgery were identified and clinical records were assessed.Inclusion criteria for enrolment were stage I-IV breast malignancy necessitating resection with or without radiotherapy/chemotherapy from 2007 to 2013. All individuals had a pre-operative assessment. The post operative assessment periodranged from 1 year to 5 years. Survival distributions were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: A total of121 patients were included in this study, with an age range of 28-78 years. Some 98% had undergone local excision/lumpectomy/ mastectomy with axillary clearance. While 81% of patients underwent chemotherapy, only 69% hadradiotherapy. Tumours were oestrogen receptor positive in 58% of cases and progesterone receptor positive in 62%.Local recurrence was detected in 10%. The mean age at diagnosis was 51.3 + 10.4 years. The overall survival analysiswas based on 22 deaths among the 121 patients (18.2%). Three-year and five-year survival rates were 87.6% and 78.4%,respectively. Analysis of recurrence-free-survival (RFS) was based on 12 events among 121 patients. The Kaplan-MeierRFS analysis revealed that in 90% of the patients with recurrence, it occurred within 45 months. The five year RFSrate was 84.5%. The median time taken from diagnosis to ablative surgery was 51 days (upper limit of 791 days).Only distant metastasis was a significant factor that impacted on both overall survival and recurrence-free survival(p<0.001). Conclusion: Overall survival among our breast cancer patients in our facility is comparable to other inother tertiary centres in the country. A trend for earlier detection was noted.
