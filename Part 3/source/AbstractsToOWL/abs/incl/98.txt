Breast cancer has the highest incidence among all malignancies diagnosed in women. Therapies have significantly improved over the years due to extensive molecular and clinical research; in a large number of cases, targeted therapies have provided better prognosis. However, one specific subtype remains elusive to targeted therapies-the triple-negative breast cancer. This immunohistochemically defined subtype is resistant to both endocrine and targeted therapies, leading to its poor prognosis. A field that is of great promise in current cancer research is epigenetics. By studying the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis-DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs-advances in cancer treatment, diagnosis, and prevention are possible. This review aims to synthesize the epigenetic discoveries that have been made related to the triple-negative breast cancer.
