Breast cancer is a chronic disease that affects both patients and their caregivers. Spouses, in particular, will generally assume the role of primary caregiver and experience significant physical, social, economic and emotional stress. In the face of cancer, being the spouse of a patient is synonymous with unmet psychosocial needs and a new role assignment, that of a primary caregiver. In addition, cancer confronts spouses with fear of partner loss. This leads to a set of adverse consequences such as depression, anxiety, uncertainty, stress, etc. Several studies have shown that breast cancer reduces the quality of life of patients' spouses and increases their emotional distress, their psychosocial needs, and their responsibilities within the family. Spouses may live a complex powerful emotional experience, which is equal to or greater than that experienced by patients during the diagnosis and treatment process. These multiple solicitations contribute to the heavy symptom burden. Therefore, in the context of breast cancer, identifying vulnerable spouses and providing them with appropriate support would help ensure better adherence to the care of their wives at different stages of the disease.
