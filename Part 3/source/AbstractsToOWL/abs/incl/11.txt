Ovarian cancer is considered the leading cause of death among gynecologic neoplasias. Breast metastases from primary ovarian cancer have been reported in only 0.03-0.6% of all breast cancers. A 38-year-old female, multipara, affected by advanced ovarian cancer and undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic peritonectomy two years earlier, was discovered to have a breast metastasis. She underwent a quadrantectomy (QSI) with an open biopsy of nodularity attached to the pectoral muscle fascia: on definitive histological characterization the breast lesions showed a high-grade invasive carcinoma, with papillary serum differentiation, and the immunohistochemistry study of breast lesion showed positivity for cytokeratin 7 and an extensive positivity for Wilm's tumor (WT)-1 and paired box 8 (PAX8). These aspects are indicative of mammary metastasis from carcinoma of ovarian origin. Despite their rarity, metastases to breast from ovarian cancer should be considered possible because their recognition and differentiation compared to primary tumors are crucial for prognosis. Future clinical studies on MOCB should be performed to discover new specific markers for a more accurate histopathological diagnosis and to establish the real need of surgical treatment.
