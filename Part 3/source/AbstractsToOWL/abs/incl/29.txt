Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue for patients with cancer comes with the concern for the existence of cancer cells in the grafts. Data about cancer cell viability after cryopreservation are currently lacking. For the experimental study of cryo-stability of cancer cells, different protocols of in vitro culture of various cell lines are used. The existing protocols are not able to mimic the effectiveness of in vivo/in situ development of cancer cells. This study aimed to test the new protocol for in vitro culture of breast cancer cells.
