Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women worldwide. The extremely fast rate of metastasis and ability to develop resistance mechanism to all the conventional drugs make them very difficult to treat which are the causes of high morbidity and mortality of breast cancer patients. Scientists throughout the world have been focusing on the early detection of breast tumor so that treatment can be started at the very early stage. Moreover, conventional treatment processes such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and local surgery suffer from various limitations including toxicity, genetic mutation of normal cells, and spreading of cancer cells to healthy tissues. Therefore, new treatment regimens with minimum toxicity to normal cells need to be urgently developed.
