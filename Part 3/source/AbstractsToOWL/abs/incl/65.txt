Breast cancer has a high mortality rate for females. Aberrant DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of breast carcinoma. By comparing DNA methylation differences between tumor breast tissue and normal breast tissue, we calculate and analyze the distributions of the hyper- and hypomethylation sites in different function regions. Results indicate that enhancer regions are often hypomethylated in breast cancer. CpG islands (CGIs) are mainly hypermethylated, while the flanking CGI (shores and shelves) is more easily hypomethylated. The hypomethylation in gene body region is related to the upregulation of gene expression, and the hypomethylation of enhancer regions is closely associated with gene expression upregulation in breast cancer. Some key hypomethylation sites in enhancer regions and key hypermethylation sites in CGIs for regulating key genes are, respectively, found, such as oncogenes ESR1 and ERBB2 and tumor suppressor genes FBLN2, CEBPA, and FAT4. This suggests that the recognizing methylation status of these genes will be useful for the diagnosis of breast cancer.
