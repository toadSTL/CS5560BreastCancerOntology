The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic significance of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with breast cancer after curative resection. Furthermore, we aimed to confirm the prognostic significance of NLR in early stage and different molecular types of breast cancer, as well as patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).A total of 2458 patients between January 2002 and December 2014 from 2 independent cohorts were analyzed retrospectively. The optimal cut-off value of NLR for recurrence was determined via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between NLR and disease-free survival (DFS).Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients with high NLR were more inclined to suffer postoperative recurrence in 2 independent cohorts. NLR was identified as independent prognostic factor for DFS of early stage breast cancer (P < .05), different types of breast cancer (P < .05) and patients treated with NACT (P < .05).Our data suggest NLR is independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. In addition, the prognostic value of NLR was further confirmed in early stage and different molecular types of breast cancer as well as patients treated with NACT.
