The patients suffering from this disease present with a large, round, mobile, fast-growing lump, and the giant PT of more than 10 cm in diameter is so uncommon. Surgery is regarded as the primary treatment, but curative efficiency of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy is so indefinite.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="Case presentation" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We reported one case of a middle-aged woman with a huge borderline PT in the right breast, over 20 cm in size. The pathology of needle core biopsy of the lump was suggestive of PT of the borderline subgroup, and then she underwent mastectomy of the right breast. The patient had recovered well without any postoperative treatment until a local recurrence occurred 1 year after operation. The tumor was removed with lumpectomy, which was pathologically diagnosed as malignant PT. We followed up her by telephone and heard about her postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as her well recovery.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The pathology of PT with low incidence is mostly benign, but local recurrence is common, and the histopathology progresses toward worsen trend. Besides, due to the difficulty in precise diagnosis of the borderline PTs, it is recommended that this subtype of patients should undergo total mastectomy. Although the curative effect of postoperative treatment has not been recognized internationally, patients, especially those with huge tumors, may benefit from these treatments.</AbstractText>
