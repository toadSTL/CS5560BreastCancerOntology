Currently, literature on the specific information needs of patients concerning the cosmetic effects of BCT is lacking. The aim of the present study was to investigate the information needs of breast cancer patients regarding the long-term cosmetic outcome after BCT.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The data from 115 women who had undergone BCT in a general teaching hospital breast cancer unit in The Netherlands were studied. Structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were conducted between October 2012 and April 2013. A mixed model of quantitative and qualitative research was used to explore patient-reported information needs. A phenomenological approach was used to analyze the qualitative data.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">This study shows that women undergoing BCT want to discuss long-term cosmetic effects. Most patients appreciate such information immediately after the diagnosis. Patients indicated that it is also important to pay attention to the cosmetic effects during the follow-up visits, because deformation of the breast can also occur at a later stage. Furthermore, half the patients indicated that they would not likely raise the subject of cosmetic effects of the treatment themselves.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Breast cancer patients have a need for long-term attention for cosmetic outcome of BCT, which should be tailored during the treatment and follow-up process.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Currently, no literature exists concerning patients' needs for information regarding the cosmetic effects of breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Bringing up the cosmetic effects of BCT by health care professionals does not appear to be a standard part of treatment and follow-up. It is expected that the quality of care and life will be improved by providing information and guidance regarding the cosmetic outcome of BCT within the existing structure of the breast cancer pathway. Discussion and visualization of the cosmetic effects prior to treatment will lead to more realistic expectations, and as a result, secondary interventions, such as partial prostheses and plastic surgery, may be easier to discuss and accept.</AbstractText>                <CopyrightInformation>© AlphaMed Press 2018.</CopyrightInformation>            </Abstract>            <AuthorList CompleteYN="Y">                <Author ValidYN="Y">                    <LastName>Brands-Appeldoorn</LastName>                    <ForeName>Angelique</ForeName>                    <Initials>A</Initials>                    <AffiliationInfo>                        <Affiliation>Department of Surgery, Máxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, The Netherlands a.brands@mmc.nl.</Affiliation>                    </AffiliationInfo>                </Author>                <Author ValidYN="Y">                    <LastName>Maaskant-Braat</LastName>                    <ForeName>Sabrina</ForeName>                    <Initials>S</Initials>                    <AffiliationInfo>                        <Affiliation>Department of Surgery, Máxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.</Affiliation>                    </AffiliationInfo>                </Author>                <Author ValidYN="Y">                    <LastName>Schenk</LastName>                    <ForeName>Karin</ForeName>                    <Initials>K</Initials>                    <AffiliationInfo>                        <Affiliation>Department of Surgery, Máxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.</Affiliation>                    </AffiliationInfo>                </Author>                <Author ValidYN="Y">                    <LastName>Roumen</LastName>                    <ForeName>Rudi</ForeName>                    <Initials>R</Initials>                    <AffiliationInfo>                        <Affiliation>Department of Surgery, Máxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, The Netherlands.</Affiliation>                    </AffiliationInfo>                    <AffiliationInfo>                        <Affiliation>Division Medical Oncology, GROW - School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht, The Netherlands.</Affiliation>                    </AffiliationInfo>                </Author>            </AuthorList>            <Language>eng</Language>            <PublicationTypeList>                <PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType>            </PublicationTypeList>            <ArticleDate DateType="Electronic">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>09</Month>                <Day>26</Day>            </ArticleDate>        </Article>        <MedlineJournalInfo>            <Country>United States</Country>            <MedlineTA>Oncologist</MedlineTA>            <NlmUniqueID>9607837</NlmUniqueID>            <ISSNLinking>1083-7159</ISSNLinking>        </MedlineJournalInfo>        <KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM">            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Breast cancer</Keyword>            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Breast‐conserving surgery</Keyword>            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Communication</Keyword>            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Information</Keyword>            <Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Quality of life</Keyword>        </KeywordList>        <CoiStatement>Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this article.</CoiStatement>    </MedlineCitation>    <PubmedData>        <History>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="received">                <Year>2017</Year>                <Month>09</Month>                <Day>09</Day>            </PubMedPubDate>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="accepted">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>07</Month>                <Day>31</Day>            </PubMedPubDate>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>9</Month>                <Day>28</Day>                <Hour>6</Hour>                <Minute>0</Minute>            </PubMedPubDate>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>9</Month>                <Day>28</Day>                <Hour>6</Hour>                <Minute>0</Minute>            </PubMedPubDate>            <PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline">                <Year>2018</Year>                <Month>9</Month>                <Day>28</Day>                <Hour>6</Hour>                <Minute>0</Minute>            </PubMedPubDate>        </History>        <PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus>        <ArticleIdList>            <ArticleId IdType="pubmed">30257892</ArticleId>            <ArticleId IdType="pii">theoncologist.2017-0443</ArticleId>            <ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0443</ArticleId>        </ArticleIdList>    </PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
