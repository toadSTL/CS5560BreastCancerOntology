Evidence suggests that complex surgeries have better outcomes in high volume academic centers. Whether clinical outcomes of women diagnosed with operable breast cancer, who are treated by multiple disciplines including non-complex surgical approaches, differ for those received all or part of their treatment at their community cancer center is unclear. We hypothesize that the clinical outcomes do not differ for those who received all or part of their care at their community cancer center. Our aim is to analyze data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who received all their treatment at community cancer center when compared with those who had part or all of their care elsewhere.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">A cohort of 162,803 women diagnosed at a community cancer center with an operable breast cancer (clinical stage I - III) between 2005 and 2014 from the NCDB was evaluated. Demographics, cancer-specific characteristics and overall survival differences between patients who stay at or leave their home institution for breast cancer treatment were compared.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Within this cohort, patients treated at multiple institutions were younger, traveled further from home for their care, and were more likely to have no comorbidities (p &lt; 0.001). Overall survival adjusted for demographics and cancer stage and subtype did not differ based on treatment at one or multiple institutions.</AbstractText>                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The decision for patients to undergo breast cancer treatment in a different institution after being diagnosed in a community center does not appear to impact overall survival.</AbstractText>                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
