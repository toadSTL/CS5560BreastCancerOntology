A series of 3-N-aryl substituted-2-heteroarylchromones was efficiently synthesized via Pd-mediated oxidative coupling under the influence of hetero-atoms neighboring group participation. Synthesized molecules were evaluated against human microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) enzyme inhibitors, a recently identified anti-cancer drug target. Among 21 synthesized molecules, compounds 2, 3, and 14 exhibited excellent inÂ vitro inhibitory effect against MARK4 with IC
