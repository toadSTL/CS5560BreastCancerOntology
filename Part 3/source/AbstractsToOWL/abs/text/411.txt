Many studies have shown that lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity are related to the incidence of cancer. However, there are few studies on the association between lifestyle factors and cancer prognosis. To investigate the influence of lifestyle factors and psychosocial factors on prognosis, we started a prospective study of women with breast cancer, the Rainbow of KIBOU study-Breast (ROK Study-B) in 2007. As of February 2018, more than 6300 women have been enrolled, thus making this one of the world's largest cancer patient cohort studies. Based on the know-how obtained from this study, we started another new cohort study for colorectal cancer patient (ROK Study-C).
