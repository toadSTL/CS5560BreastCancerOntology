This study aimed to determine cancer prevalence occurring after the age of 75 in 45 French nursing homes (NH), as well as residents' characteristics and parameters associated with cancer-specific management. Descriptive retrospective study including 214 residents (mean age, 89.7 years) with cancer diagnosed after age 75. The studied parameters were sociodemographic, functional, nutritional and cognitive data; comorbidity assessment; date of tumoral diagnosis; cancer type; tumoral stage; treatment plan; multidisciplinary staff decision and oncologic follow-up. Our results showed that cancer prevalence in NH was 8.4 ± 1.1%, diagnosed before admission in 63% of cases. The most common tumoral sites were skin (26%), digestive tract and breast (18% for both); 12% had metastasis. Cognitive impairment was the most common comorbidity (42%), and 44% of the residents were highly dependent. Multivariate analysis showed that therapeutic decisions were associated with age. Older patients had less staging exploration (odd ratios [ORs], 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.97) and underwent less cancer-specific treatment (ORs, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.86-0.99). Oncologic follow-up was more frequent in younger patients (ORs, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.81-0.99) and those with recent diagnosis (ORs, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.23-0.61). This study identified factors associated with substandard neoplastic management in elderly NH residents. It highlights needs for information, education and training in cancer detection to improve cancer consideration and care in NH.
