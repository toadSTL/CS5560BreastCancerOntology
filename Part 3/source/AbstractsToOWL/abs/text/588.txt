Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a recently described form of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma now formally recognized by the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms. The disease most often presents with a delayed seroma around the breast implant, almost exclusively with a textured surface, and manifests with breast pain, swelling or asymmetry, capsular contracture, but can also present with a breast mass, and lymph node involvement. The prognosis of BIA-ALCL is favorable compared with many other subtypes of systemic T-cell lymphoma; however, unlike other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, complete surgical excision for localized disease is an important part of the management of these patients. In this paper, we share our recommendations for a multidisciplinary team approach to the diagnosis, workup, and treatment of BIA-ALCL in line with consensus guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
