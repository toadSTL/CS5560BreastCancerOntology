This study is intended to analyze differences in the self-rated health of patients according to the characteristics of hospitalized cancer patients. To this end, this study analyzed the differences in self-rated health according to cancer diagnosis type, cancer stage and adjunctive treatment and analyzed the recognition of difficulties in physical activities during hospitalization. A questionnaire survey was conducted among data of 162 hospitalized cancer patients. For the self-rated health of cancer patients according to diagnosis type, it was lower in the gastric cancer group than in the thyroid cancer group and the breast cancer group. For self-rated health according to cancer stage, it was higher in the order of the stage 3 group, stage 2 group and stage 1 group. For the self-rated health of patients receiving adjunctive treatment, it was the lowest in the chemotherapy+radiotherapy group. And for personal constraints according to cancer stage in the category of "physical," it was higher in the stage 3 group than in the stage 1 group. For hospital environment restrictions according to cancer stage in the category of "tool," it was higher in the stage 1 group than in the stage 3 group. In conclusion, personal constraints on the physical activities of cancer patients appear to be due to fatigue and a lack of motivation, but medical services that influence motivation are critical to individual and continued care strategies for the patients.
