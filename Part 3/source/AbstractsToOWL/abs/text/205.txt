The identification of molecular biomarkers for classification of breast cancer is needed to better stratify the patients and guide therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of MAPRE1 gene encoding microtubule-end binding proteins EB1 as a biomarker in breast cancer and evaluate whether combinatorial expression of MAPRE1 and MTUS1 gene encoding EB1-negative regulator ATIP3 may improve breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
