A 62-year-old woman, with the history of breast and colorectal cancer, presented intermittent diplopia. A cerebellar lesion was revealed by F-FDG PET-MRI without post-gadolinium enhancement, but with increased perfusion and strong F-FDG uptake. The diagnosis of Cowden syndrome with PTEN gene mutation, linked to higher risk of neoplasia and occurrence of hamartomatous lesions characteristic of the Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD), was confirmed by genetic investigation.
