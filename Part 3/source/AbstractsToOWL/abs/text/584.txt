Replication factor C (RFC) family is a complex comprised of the RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, and RFC5 subunits, which acts as a primer recognition factor for DNA polymerase. It is reported that RFC, biologically active in various malignant tumors, may play an important role in the proliferation, progression, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. It could act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene based on the cellular and histological characteristics of the tumor. In this review, we summarized the updated researches on the structure, physiological function, and expression pattern of RFC in a variety of tumors, the underlying mechanisms on carcinogenesis, and the potentials of RFC family members in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction.
