Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is a recently developed breast imaging technique. CESM relies on dual-energy acquisition following contrast agent injection to improve mammography sensitivity. CESM is comparable to contrast-enhanced MRI in terms of sensitivity, at a fraction of the cost. However, since lesion variability is large, even with the improved visibility provided by CESM, differentiation between benign and malignant enhancement is not accurate and a biopsy is usually performed for final assessment. Breast biopsies can be stressful to the patient and are expensive to healthcare systems. Moreover, as the biopsies results are most of the time benign, a specificity improvement in the radiologist diagnosis is required. This work presents a deep learning-based decision support system, which aims at improving the specificity of breast cancer diagnosis by CESM without affecting sensitivity.
