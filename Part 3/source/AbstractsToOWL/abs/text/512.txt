In April 2015, we initiated a training program to facilitate earlier diagnosis of breast cancer among women with breast symptoms in rural Rwanda. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of the training intervention in breast cancer detection on knowledge and skills among health center nurses and community health workers (CHWs).
