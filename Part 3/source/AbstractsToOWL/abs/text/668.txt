We report a novel multifunctional hyperbranched polymer based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a nanomedicine platform that facilitates longitudinal and quantitative 89Zr-PET imaging, enhancing knowledge of nanomaterial biodistribution and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics both in vivo and ex vivo. Anti-VEGF-A DNA aptamer functionalization increased tumour accumulation by >2-fold in a breast cancer model.
