Inflammatory tumour (IPT) consists of spindle cells, mature plasma cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Most frequently presenting in the respiratory tract it can also affect other sites such as breast. This case was a 73-year old woman presenting with a left breast lump, clinically indeterminate (P3), proven on biopsy to be IPT. Seven years later she returned with bilateral breast lumps and underwent triple assessment followed by wide excisions which confirmed the diagnosis of IPTs. Because it can be difficult to differentiate IPT from a low-grade spindle cell metaplastic breast carcinoma (SpCMBC) wide excision to achieve clear margins should be achieved to exclude malignancy.
