Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in adults. They usually originate from: lung, breast, renal cell and gastrointestinal cancers, as well as melanoma. Prognosis for brain metastases is still poor and classical treatment combining surgery and radiation therapy should be strongly supported with molecular approaches. However, their successful application depends on a deep understanding of not only genetic, but also epigenetic background of the disease. That will result in an earlier and more precise diagnosis, successful treatment, as well as individualized estimation of clinical outcomes and prognosis. It has already been shown that the epigenetic machinery plays a crucial role in cancer biology, development, and progression. Therefore, we decided to look for metastasis through changes in the most studied epigenetic mark, 5-methylcytosine (m
