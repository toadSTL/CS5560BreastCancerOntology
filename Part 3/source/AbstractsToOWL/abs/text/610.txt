Cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders remain a challenging aspect of dermatopathology, in part due to the rarity of the entities and extreme variability in clinical outcomes. Although many of the entities remain unchanged, the approach to some of them has changed in the new 2016 classification scheme of the World Health Organization. Chief among these are Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders such as Epstein-Barr virus-associated mucocutaneous ulcer and hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disorder, primary cutaneous CD8+ aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous acral CD8+ T-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, and breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In addition, translocations and gene rearrangements such as those involving the 6p25.3 locus have started to inform diagnosis and classification of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and lymphomatoid papulosis. In this review, we will examine what is new in the diagnostic toolbox of cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders.
