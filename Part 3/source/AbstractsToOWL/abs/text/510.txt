Data quality is a core value of cancer registries, which bring about greater understanding of cancer distribution and determinants. Thailand established its cancer registry in 1986; however, studies focusing on data reliability have been limited. This study aimed to assess the coding completeness and reliability of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) hospital-based cancer registry, Thailand.
