The simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of cancer cells plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We developed a novel DNA-labeled sandwich electrochemical biosensor based on a glassy carbon electrode modified with 3D graphene and a hybrid of Au nanocages (Au NCs)/amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-NH
