Subcutaneous (s.c.) trastuzumab was introduced in the (neo)adjuvant setting, based on the non-inferiority results and patient preference. In the advanced setting, preliminary safety data have only been reported. We conducted an observational study of s.c. trastuzumab in combination with i.v. pertuzumab and docetaxel in the first-line setting of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer.
