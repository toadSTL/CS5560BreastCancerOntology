Modulating the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is an effective way to treat for cancer. We previously reported a potent non-secosteroidal VDR modulator (sw-22) with modest anti-tumor activity, which could be due to its undesirable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity and structure-property relationships around the 2'-hydroxyl group of sw-22 to improve the physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic properties and anti-tumor activity. Compounds 19a and 27b, the potent non-secosteroidal VDR modulators, were identified as the most effective molecules in inhibiting the proliferation of three cancer cell lines, particularly breast cancer cells, with a low IC
