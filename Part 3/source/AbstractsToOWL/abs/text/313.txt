Currently, attention has been given to complications related to breast implants, especially due to the presence of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) related to silicone implants. Many manuscripts attempt to associate silicone presence with clinical complaints reported by patients, while others try to demonstrate the mechanisms of silicone bleeding by permeability loss of breast implant surfaces. There also are reports of foreign body type reactions from implant fibrous capsule to silicone corpuscles. However, there seems to be no study that correlates the clinical, radiological, and histological correlations of these lesions. The objective of this review is to correlate radiological findings of silicone-induced granuloma of breast implant capsule (SIGBIC) from breast MRI (BMRI) scans and complementary findings of ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and its histology originated from surgical breast implant capsulectomy. To make this correlation possible, we divided SIGBIC into three radiological findings: (1) intracapsular SIGBIC, (2) SIGBIC with extracapsular extension, and (3) mixed SIGBIC associated with seroma. Our experience demonstrates histological-radiological correlation in SIGBIC diagnosis. Knowledge of these findings may demonstrate its real importance in terms of public health and patient management. We believe that SIGBIC is currently underdiagnosed by lack of training, guidance, and management in our clinical practice.
