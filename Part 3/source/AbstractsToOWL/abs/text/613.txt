The well-being of young cancer survivors is hampered due to the toxic effects of chemotherapy on the ovaries, resulting in infertility. We report a case of a 42-year-old woman with a history of bilateral ductal carcinoma of the breast who underwent radical mastectomy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy was anxious to conceive. In vitro fertilization was performed with donor oocyte; the patient became pregnant and delivered a full term baby with no congenital anomalies. As very few have a background for providing guidance and treatment in this setting, this report highlights the possibility of improving the quality of reproductive life of young survivors by various assisted reproductive techniques, the importance of fertility preservation and a multidisciplinary team approach.
