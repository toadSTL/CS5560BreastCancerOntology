Breast carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) is infrequent, being most reported cased described as ductal invasive carcinomas. Invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (PLC) is a distinct morphological variant of invasive lobular carcinoma characterized by higher nuclear atypia and pleomorphism than the classical type. In the best of our knowledge, a PLC with OGCs has not been previously reported.
