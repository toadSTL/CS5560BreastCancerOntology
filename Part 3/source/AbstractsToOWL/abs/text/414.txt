An 85-year old woman who had a large tumor in the left breast came to our out-patient clinic. Computed tomography showed multiple lung tumors in addition to a huge tumor in the left breast. A needle biopsy brought about a histological diagnosis of ductal carcinoma. A simple mastectomy was performed and a histological examination using the resected specimen demonstrated a coexistence of an adenoid structure and a false ductal structure according the histologic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma, which is quite rare among breast tumors.
