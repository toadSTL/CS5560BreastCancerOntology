Skull-base metastases frequently cause progressive ipsilateral disturbances of cranial nerves or pain, resulting in poor quality of life in patients with cancer. Magnetic resonance(MR)imaging is the method to detect skull-base metastases, which demonstrates focal lesions of low-intensity signal and enhancement on T1-weighted MR images.
