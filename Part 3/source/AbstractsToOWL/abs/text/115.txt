Radiation-associated angiosarcoma (RAAS) is a rare subtype of secondary angiosarcoma that is characterized by rapid proliferation and extensive tissue infiltration. Although various treatments for RAAS (such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy) have been reported, there is no consensus as to which approach is the best.
