Early phase therapeutic trials in oncology are being offered to an increasing number of patients. The objective of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the treatment efficacy and survival of patients included in early phase trials at the "Institut de Canc√©rologie de l'Ouest" (ICO), as well as the interest of the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) and PRONOPALL scores in this population.
