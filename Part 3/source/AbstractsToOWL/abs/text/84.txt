Metastatic lesions to the proximal femur occur frequently and require special consideration due to the high risk of pathologic fractures. Type of surgery might influence patient survival considering the growing concept of oligometastases. In fact, the use of modular tumor megaprosthesis is increasing in the last decades compared to intramedullary nailing. Aim of this study was to evaluate oncological and functional results of treatment in patients with pathologic or impending fracture of the proximal femur, with patient survival being the primary, complications the secondary, and functional results the tertiary endpoint.
