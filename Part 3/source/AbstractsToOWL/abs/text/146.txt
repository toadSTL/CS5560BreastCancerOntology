Correct diagnosis of pulmonary tumors is essential for treatment decision and often rely on immunohistochemical markers. We stained tissue microarrays from resected primary lung cancer (n=665) and pulmonary metastases (n=425) for CK7, CK20, CDX2, CK5, p40, p63, TTF-1, napsin A, GATA3 and PAX8 to systematically assess the diagnostic value of these markers. Primary lung adenocarcinomas expressed TTF-1 in 90% and napsin A in 84% of the cases, while 10% were positive for p63, 7% for CDX2, 2% for CK20 and 2% for GATA3. Only 68% of the lung adenocarcinomas were positive for CK7, TTF-1 and napsin A and negative for all other markers. Primary lung squamous cell carcinomas expressed CK5, p40 and p63 in 94-97% of cases, while 44% were positive for CK7, 20% for GATA3, 7% for CDX2 and 3% for TTF-1. Rare cases expressed PAX8, CK20 or napsin A. Pulmonary metastases of colorectal cancer were positive for CK20 in 83% and CDX2 in 99% of the cases. Rare cases expressed CK7, p63 or PAX8, while 4% expressed TTF-1. Pulmonary metastases of renal cell carcinomas were positive for PAX8 in 74%, napsin A in 7% and CK7 in 7% of the cases. Pulmonary metastases of breast cancer were positive for GATA3 in 93% and CK7 in 78% of the cases, while 15% expressed CK5. Information on expression and patterns of immunohistochemical markers facilitates histopathological diagnostics. Evidently, unusual immune profiles occur and may lead to incorrect diagnosis.
