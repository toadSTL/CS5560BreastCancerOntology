Australian population data regarding the number and sociodemographic characteristics of children affected by a parent's cancer are not currently available. Moreover, predictions that this population is increasing have not been tested. This study provides data on the number and sociodemographic characteristics of parents with cancer and their young children (aged 0-11Â years) in the state of Western Australia, and investigates whether long-term trends in this population have increased over time.
