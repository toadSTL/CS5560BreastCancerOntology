Virtually all diseases affect multiple organs. However, our knowledge of the body-wide effects remains limited. Here, we report the body-wide transcriptome landscape across 13-23 organs of mouse models of myocardial infarction, diabetes, kidney diseases, cancer, and pre-mature aging. Using such datasets, we find (1) differential gene expression in diverse organs across all models; (2) skin as a disease-sensor organ represented by disease-specific activities of putative gene-expression network; (3) a bone-skin cross talk mediated by a bone-derived hormone, FGF23, in response to dysregulated phosphate homeostasis, a known risk-factor for kidney diseases; (4) candidates for the signature activities of many more putative inter-organ cross talk for diseases; and (5) a cross-species map illustrating organ-to-organ and model-to-disease relationships between human and mouse. These findings demonstrate the usefulness and the potential of such body-wide datasets encompassing mouse models of diverse disease types as a resource in biological and medical sciences. Furthermore, the findings described herein could be exploited for designing disease diagnosis and treatment.
