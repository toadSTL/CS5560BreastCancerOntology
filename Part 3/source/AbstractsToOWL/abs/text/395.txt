Calvarial and dural metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) are rarely reported in the medical literature. Most frequent calvarial metastases are seen to originate from lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Thyroid cancer metastases are generally well vascularized and cause destruction in the bone tissues. First choice of treatment in distant metastases of PTC is surgery and radioactive iodine treatment for the primary cause. Postsurgical radiotherapy is used in accepted and suitable patients.
