Phyllodes tumor (PT) is an extremely rare tumor of the breast of mixed mesenchymal and epithelial origin. It may pursue a benign or malignant evolution with distant metastases in the latter case in 3-12% of patients. The most common sites of metastases are the lungs and bones. Although theoretically any organ may have metastasis, it is extremely rare that a PT will metastasize to the bilateral ovaries and present as Krukenberg tumor. Herein, we report such a case.
