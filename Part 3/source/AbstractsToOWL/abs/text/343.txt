Circulating tumor cells have emerged as biomarkers for estimating the tumor burden and metastatic potential of cancer patients. However, to date, most of studies and applications of circulating tumor cells have been conducted and applied to epithelial cancers such as breast, colorectal, and prostate tumor. The only FDA-cleared method, CellSearch, makes use of antibody against epithelial surface protein expressed on CTCs, thus obstructing wide application for various cancers with non-epithelial and semi-epithelial characteristics including renal cell carcinoma. Due to rarity and ambiguity of CTCs, designed experiment including non-biased CTC isolation and subsequent cytopathological study for finding applicable immunomarkers are urgently needed for clinical use of CTCs for less-studied cancers. Here, in order to construct the fundamental step for CTC diagnosis without limitation of its epithelial characteristics, we present the simple and novel method which incorporate both label-free CTC isolation and pathological study using hydrogel-based cell block formation. Six cell lines from lung, ovarian, kidney cancers were used to make cell block and analyzed by conventional immunocytochemical staining method to find the candidate markers for CTC. Especially for renal cancer, the physically isolated CTCs were further immunocytochemically examined with the screened candidate markers by cell block construction, and verified their clinical utility using blood samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma. This comprehensive study demonstrates that the present approach can be used to find the potential markers for any type of cancers regardless of their epithelial characteristics and isolate the specific type of CTCs in label-free manners.
