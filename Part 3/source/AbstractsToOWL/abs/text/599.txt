As diagnosing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) is often challenging, we reviewed clinicopathological features of t-MN patients. Medical records of 138 patients, diagnosed with t-MN between 1995 and 2017, were reviewed. Of 138 patients, 80 had t-MDS, 53 t-AML, and 5 t-MDS/MPN (age, 22-88 years; median 64 years; male/female ratio, 0.8). The median latency time was 6 years and 5 months. Of 115 patients, 56 patients received cytotoxic-/radiotherapy for a solid tumor, 56 for hematological malignancy, and 3 for an auto-immune disorder, respectively. Another 21 patients had a combination of 2 disorders. Moreover, 2 patients had 3 previous malignancies. Breast cancer was the most prevalent tumor, followed by low-grade B non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunophenotyping and immunohistochemistry showed aberrant expression of B-, T-, or NK-cell markers in 21% and 6%, respectively. In 90% of the patients, dysplasia in ≥ 1 lineage was found. KMT2A fusion gene transcripts were seen in 5%. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex karyotypes (31%) and chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities (40%). Almost 82% of the patients died and the median overall survival was about 1 year. Our study confirms that previous therapy for breast cancer is the most important cause of t-MN. KMT2A fusion genes are prevalent and complex karyotypes and/or chromosomes 5 and/or 7 abnormalities are common.
