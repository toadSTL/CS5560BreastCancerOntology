Breast-conserving treatment (BCT) for breast cancer can lead to deformation of the treated breast, resulting in patient dissatisfaction with the final cosmetic outcome. Currently, literature on the specific information needs of patients concerning the cosmetic effects of BCT is lacking. The aim of the present study was to investigate the information needs of breast cancer patients regarding the long-term cosmetic outcome after BCT.
