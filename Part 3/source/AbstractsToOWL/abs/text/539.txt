A high serum HER-2 extracellular domain (sHER-2 ECD) level has a reverse association with tumor behaviors. In this study, a portable platform for the disease biomarker sHER-2 ECD detection has been established using a pressure-based bioassay. The pressure bioassay consists of a monoclonal antibody immobilized on an eight-well strip, the analyte HER-2, and another monoclonal antibody labeled with the Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs), which have the catalytic ability to decompose H
