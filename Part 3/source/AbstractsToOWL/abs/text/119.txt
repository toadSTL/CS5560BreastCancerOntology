MicroRNA (miRNA)-34 family (miR-34s), including miR-34a/b/c, is the most well studied non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The miR-34s mediates the tumor suppressor function of p53 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer by targeting different oncogenes. This review focuses on the anti-oncogenic regulation of the miR-34s, emphasizing the major signaling pathways that are involved in the modulation of miR-34s in breast cancer. Moreover, it highlights how epigenetic modification by the p53/miR-34s axis regulates the proliferation, invasiveness, chemoresistance, and sternness of breast cancer. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of miR-34s will open new opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and define a new approach in identifying potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of breast cancer.
