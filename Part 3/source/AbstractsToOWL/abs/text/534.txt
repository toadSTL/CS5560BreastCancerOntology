Breast metastasis from ovarian cancer is a rare event, with vary clinical and imaging presentations, depends on the form of dissemination of the disease and may mimic primary benign and malignant lesions.Confirmation of the diagnosis is of pivotal importance to choice an adequate therapeutic planning, allowing to avoid unnecessary surgeries and to provide appropriate systemic therapy. In this manuscript, we present a case of breast metastasis from ovarian cancer. The patient presented to our Institute with a localized, palpable mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography and breast sonography showed a singular, round, and homogenous mass with regular borders. No suspicious axillary node was observed. Lesion biopsy revealed the presence of epithelial malignant tumor cells, compatible with a tube-ovarian serous histotype. So, although it could be rare, secondary malignant neoplasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions in patients with a personal history of ovarian cancer.
