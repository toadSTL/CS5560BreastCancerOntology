Sensitivity to detect breast cancer (BC) is not high in a dense breast due to masking in mammography. To evaluate the breast density, a volumetric measurement system has been recently developed that measures the percent fibroglandular tissue volume (percent FGV, hereafter termed as "FG%") to the breast volume (BV). This study was designed to investigate whether evaluation using FG% can accurately predict the masking risk by comparing with the current standard method of subjective visual estimation (SVE).
