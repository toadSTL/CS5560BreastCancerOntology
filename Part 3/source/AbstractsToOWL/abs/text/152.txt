Breast cancer is the most relevant kind of cancer and the second cause of cancer- related deaths among women in general. Currently, there is no effective treatment for breast cancer although advances in its initial diagnosis and treatment available. Therefore, the value of novel anti-tumor therapeutic modalities remains an immediate unmet need in clinical practice. Following our previous work regarding to the properties of the Pluronics with different photosensitizer (PS) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), in this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of supersaturated hypericin (HYP) encapsulated on PluronicÂ® P123 (HYP/P123) against breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and non-tumorigenic breast cells (MCF-10A).
