Our work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria [21]. Mammary tuberculosis (TM) is an extremely rare condition (Khanna et al., 2000 [1]). It has been estimated to be 0.1% of breast lesions examined histologically, but it reaches 3-4% in countries such as India and Africa where the disease shows a high incidence. This disease can present a diagnostic problem in radiological and microbiological investigations, and thus extreme caution is necessary.
