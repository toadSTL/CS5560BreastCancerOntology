Multi-stimuli-responsive theranostic nanoplatform integrating functions of both imaging and multimodal therapeutics holds great promise for improving diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we reported a pH, glutathione (GSH) and hyaluronidase (HAase) triple-responsive nanoplatform for HER2 and CD44 dual-targeted and fluorescence imaging-guided PDT/PTT dual-therapy against HER2-overexpressed breast cancer. The nanoplatform was fabricated by functionalizing gold nanorods (GNRs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) bearing pendant hydrazide and thiol groups via Au-S bonds, and subsequently chemically conjugating 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), Cy7.5 and anti-HER2 antibody onto HA moiety for PDT, fluorescence imaging and active targeting, respectively. The resulting versatile nanoplatform GNR-HA
