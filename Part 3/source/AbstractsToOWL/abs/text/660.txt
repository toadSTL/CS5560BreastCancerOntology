A prototype system for breast imaging using monochromatic X-rays has been developed using a scanning multilayer X-ray mirror in combination with a conventional mammography tube and an imaging detector. The X-ray mirror produces a monochromatic fan beam tuned near 19 keV, with an energy bandpass of approximately 1.5 keV. Rotating the mirror about the tube's focal spot in synchronization with the X-ray generator and detector enables the acquisition of monochromatic X-ray images over large areas. The X-ray mirror also can be rotated completely out of the beam so that conventional polychromatic images can be acquired using a K-edge filter, facilitating direct comparison between the two modes of operation. The system was used to image synthetic, tissue-equivalent breast phantoms in order to experimentally quantify the improvements in image quality and dose that can be realized using monochromatic radiation. Nine custom phantoms spanning a range of thicknesses and glandular/adipose ratios, each containing both glandular- and calcification-equivalent features, were used to measure contrast and signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR). Mean glandular dose (MGD) was computed from measured entrance exposure, and a figure-of-merit (FOM) was computed as FOM = SDNR
