Tuberculosis (TBC) is a major public health problem with high mortality especially in developing countries. It is associated with a higher risk of developing pulmonary and non-pulmonary malignancies including solid and hematologic cancers. Association between TBC and nonpulmonary malignancies is rarely described in the literature.
