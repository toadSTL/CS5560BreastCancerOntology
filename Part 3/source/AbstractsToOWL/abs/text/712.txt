About 5% of breast cancer cases are metastatic at diagnosis, and 20%-30% of localized breast cancer cases become secondarily metastatic. Patients frequently report many detrimental symptoms related to metastasis and treatments. The physical, biological, psychological, and clinical benefits of physical activity during treatment in patients with localized breast cancer have been demonstrated; however, limited literature exists regarding physical activity and physical activity behavior change in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
