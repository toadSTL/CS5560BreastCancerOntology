Specific targeting and phototriggered therapy in mouse model have recently emerged as the starting point of cancer theragnosis. Herein, we report a bioresponsive and degradable nanohybrid, a liposomal nanohybrid decorated with red emissive carbon dots, for localized tumor imaging and light-mediated tumor growth inhibition. Unsaturated carbon dots (C-dots) anchored to liposomes convert near-infrared (NIR) light into heat and also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), demonstrating the capability of phototriggered cancer cell death and tumor regression. The photothermal and oxidative damage of breast tumor by the nonmetallic nanohybrid has also been demonstrated. Designed nanoparticles show excellent aqueous dispersibility, biocompatibility, light irradiated enhanced cellular uptake, release of reactive oxygen species, prolonged and specific tumor binding ability and good photothermal response (62 Â°C in 5 minutes). Safe and localized irradiation of 808 nm light demonstrates significant tumor growth inhibition and bioresponsive degradation of the fluorescent nanohybrid without affecting the surrounding healthy tissues.
