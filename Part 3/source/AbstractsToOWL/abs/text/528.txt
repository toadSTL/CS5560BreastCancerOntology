The aim of this study was to assess the incidence rate and the risk factors for late complications associated with use of central totally implanted venous access devices (TIVAPs) in patients with cancer, and to devise nursing strategies to minimize late complications.This retrospective study included 500 patients with TIVAPs from 2012 to 2015. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of sex, age, primary diagnosis, duration of surgery, and the length of hospital stay on the incidence of late complications of TIVAP.The cumulative maintenance period of TIVAP was 159,605 days. Late complications included catheter-related obstruction (n = 14; 2.8%), infection (n = 3; 0.6%), drug extravasation (n = 1; 0.2%), and catheter exposure (n = 1; 0.2%). Multivariate analyses revealed that age, breast cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer were risk factors for the late complications associated with TIVAP.There was a low incidence of late complications with TIVAP use. Catheter-related obstruction is the most frequent late complication of TIVAP. Risk factors for TIVAP-associated late complications include age and certain cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer.
