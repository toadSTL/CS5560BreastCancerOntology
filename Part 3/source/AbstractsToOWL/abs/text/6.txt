Phyllodes tumor (PT) is a rare breast fibroepithelial biphasic tumor composed of stromal and epithelial components. The patients suffering from this disease present with a large, round, mobile, fast-growing lump, and the giant PT of more than 10 cm in diameter is so uncommon. Surgery is regarded as the primary treatment, but curative efficiency of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy is so indefinite.
