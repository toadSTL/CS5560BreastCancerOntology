There is a substantial racial/ethnic disparity in female breast cancer mortality in Chicago between Non-Hispanic Black (NHBlack) and Hispanic patients compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHWhite) counterparts prompting a multilevel examination of factors that might account for the disparity, with the goal of identifying potential policy interventions that might meaningfully address it Methods:In the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago study, 411 NHBlack, 397 NHWhite and 181 Hispanic patients diagnosed between the ages of 30-79 were interviewed, and medical records were abstracted information on screening and diagnostic follow-up. We conducted a multilevel analysis to assess the role of neighborhood context, patient resources, facility characteristics and mode of detection in determining the disparity in later stage at diagnosis Results:After adjustment for neighborhood context, mode of detection and facility accreditation/resources, there was no significant disparity in later stage breast cancer diagnosis between NHBlack or Hispanic patients compared to NHWhite patients.
