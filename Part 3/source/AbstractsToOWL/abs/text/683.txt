Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is characterized by a prolonged risk of recurrence. Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy improves disease-free survival (DFS), but no effect on overall survival has been observed. This may be explained by changes in the relative contribution of local, regional and distant recurrences as well as non-breast cancer death to DFS events over time.
