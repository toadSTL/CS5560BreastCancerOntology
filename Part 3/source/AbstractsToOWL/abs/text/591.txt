BACKGROUND The aims of this study were to investigate the incidence and risk factors for the development of bone metastases and prognosis in women with cancer of the uterine cervix using database analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was analyzed for the incidence and survival rates of women diagnosed with uterine cervical cancer in the United States between 2010-2015. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for bone metastases. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the overall survival. Proportional hazard regression analysis estimated prognostic factors associated with bone metastases. RESULTS There were 19,363 women with uterine cervical cancer, and 469 women were diagnosed with bone metastases on initial diagnosis (2.42%). Increased T-stage, N-stage, non-squamous and non-adenocarcinoma histology, high-grade tumors, and the presence of lung, liver, and brain metastases were all significantly associated with early bone metastases. There were 364 patients with cervical cancer and bone metastases on initial diagnosis who were followed-up for at least one year. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that unmarried status and lung, liver, and brain metastases were significantly associated with reduced overall survival. No other significant risk or prognostic associations were found. CONCLUSIONS SEER data analysis showed that women with uterine cervical cancer had some standard risk factors associated with bone metastases, and with prognosis, but a heterogeneous group of risk factors was also present. The findings of this study may have clinical application in screening for bone metastases in women with cervical cancer.
