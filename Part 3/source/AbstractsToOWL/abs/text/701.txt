In addition to the physical burden, the quality of life and survival in patients with cancer may also be reduced because of psychological distress, such as spiritual crisis, anxiety, and depression. Many studies have verified that spirituality could reduce anxiety and depression and improve quality of life and adjustment to cancer. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of spiritual interventions in patients with cancer. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to use randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of spiritual interventions on spiritual and psychological outcomes and quality of life in patients with cancer.
