Anti-resorptive drugs like bisphosphonates (BP) and denosumab are widely used for prevention and treatment of skeletal diseases, such as osteoporosis and bone metastases and mainly work through the prevention of osteoclast-mediated bones resorption. BP can lead to atypical femoral fractures (AFF) that is a rare, easily misdiagnosed treatment-related complication with great impact on the quality of life of patients. We present a concise review of the literature on BP related AFF based on the cases of 3 breast cancer patients that reflect the diagnostic pitfall of this rare entity. In conclusion, breast cancer patients very often are exposed to BP use and are at risk of developing AFF.
