A 48-year-old woman was admitted for pectoralgia and dyspnea. Tomography revealed a giant lung bulla with a mass arose from the bulla wall in the left lower lobes, and left lower lobes pulmonary wedge resection was performed through video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). The giant bulla was formed by fibrous connective tissue covered by monolayer pavement epithelium. The trabecular bone, cartilage and adipose tissue were found in the nodular lesion. The final diagnosis was giant pulmonary bulla with hamartoma, a very rare condition and previously unreported in the literature. Surgical approach for complete resection of the bulla was a curative treatment.
