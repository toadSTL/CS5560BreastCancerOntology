Resistance to trastuzumab has become a leading cause of mortality in breast cancer patients and is one of the major obstacles for improving the clinical outcome. Cell behavior can be modulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the contribution of lncRNAs in trastuzumab resistance to breast cancer is largely unknown. To this end, the involvement and regulatory function of lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 in human breast cancer are yet to be investigated.
