Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a commonly used antihormonal therapy in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, specifically in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. AI-associated tendinopathy and muscle tendon rupture is exceedingly rare. Until now, only one case with AI-associated severe tendinopathy has been reported in the medical literature, and there are no recorded cases of AI-associated muscle tendon rapture. We report three cases of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who experienced tendinopathy or muscle tendon rupture under antihormonal treatment with letrozole. All of the three women were in the adjuvant setting, and the treatment of tendinopathy or tendon rupture consisted of AI discontinuation, initiation of corticosteroids, or surgical treatment. Diagnosis was made via MRI. Furthermore, in our cases, there were no signs of underlying systemic disease, there was no abnormal physical activity preceding the complaints, and there was no use of other drugs beside letrozole. AIs are one of the most commonly used drugs in antihormonal therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In every case of a female patient with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer under treatment with AIs and arthralgia, an MRI should be performed in order to exclude the presence of tendinopathy or muscle tendon rupture.
