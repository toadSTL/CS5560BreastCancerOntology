Although anticancer traditional Korean medicine treatment (ACTKMT) is widely applied to patients with cancer together with, or in place of, conventional cancer treatment in Korea, the cohort evidence on its clinical effects is lacking. Therefore, this prospective cohort study is designed to evaluate the effect of ACTKMT on the survival and the clinical outcomes for patients being treated at an integrative oncology clinic.This is a single center, prospective cohort study of patients within 1 year after the diagnosis of primary lung, breast, gastric, colorectal, hepatic, uterine, or ovarian cancer. The event-free survival, disease-free survival/progression-free survival, the overall survival, the results of blood tests, and telomere-length information will be compared between patients receiving and patients not receiving a key ACTKMT (HangAmDan-B1, Geonchil-jung, and/or cultivated wild ginseng pharmacopuncture), and the correlation between the use of the key ACTKMT and the prognosis will be identified considering other risk factors.This study has received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board, Dunsan Korean Medicine Hospital of Daejeon University (No. DJDSKH-16-BM-09). The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Clinical Research Information Service: KCT0002160.
