The aim of this study was to highlight the advantages that propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PB-CT) with synchrotron radiation can provide in breast cancer diagnostics. For the first time, a fresh and intact mastectomy sample from a 60 year old patient was scanned on the IMBL beamline at the Australian Synchrotron in PB-CT mode and reconstructed. The clinical picture was described and characterized by an experienced breast radiologist, who underlined the advantages of providing diagnosis on a PB-CT volume rather than conventional two-dimensional modalities. Subsequently, the image quality was assessed by 11 breast radiologists and medical imaging experts using a radiological scoring system. The results indicate that, with the radiation dose delivered to the sample being equal, the accuracy of a diagnosis made on PB-CT images is significantly higher than one using conventional techniques.
