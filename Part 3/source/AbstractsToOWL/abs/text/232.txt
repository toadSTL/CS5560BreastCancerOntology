Metastatic involvement of the ovaries is not rare. The most common tumor types metastasizing to the ovaries, from non-gynecological organs, are breast, colorectal, gastric, and appendix tumors. Lymphogenous, hematogenous, and transcoelomic pathways have all been proposed among potential pathways. Early diagnosis and treatment have an important potential to improve the patient outcome. Krukenberg tumors typically appear as complex semisolid masses with varying amounts of solid and cystic components. Ovarian metastases from the colon primaries are predominantly cystic in nature. Secondary lymphomatous involvement of ovary is mostly bilateral and solid with heterogeneous signal intensity on MRI. Metastatic breast cancer to the ovaries is typically bilateral and tends to be of small size. Among all the other imaging characteristics, bilateral involvement of secondary tumors of the ovary appears to be most potentially helpful finding in differentiating from primary ones.
