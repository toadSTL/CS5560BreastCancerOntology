Metastatic gastric tumor originating from breast cancer (MGTBC) is rare. Endoscopically, gastric cancer (GC)-like lesions and submucosal tumors (SMT) are the features of MGTBC. Their clinicopathological characteristics are currently uncertain. We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics of 11 patients with MGTBC to better understand the disease progression and thereby improve early detection methods.
