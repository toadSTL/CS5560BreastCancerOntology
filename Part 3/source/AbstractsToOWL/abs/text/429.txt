The WORLD07 study was a female-specific database, to prospectively characterise the clinical, histological, molecular and treatment-related features in Spanish women with lung cancer. Data were collected from patients' medical records and patient interviews from October 2007 to December 2012. A total of 2,060 women were analysed: median age, 61.3 years; white, 98.6%; postmenopausal, 80.2%; and no smokers, 55% including never smokers and ex-smokers. A family history of cancer was found in 42.5% of patients, 12.0% of patients had had a previous history of cancer (breast cancer, 39.7%). Most patients (85.8%) were diagnosed of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), most commonly reported with adenocarcinoma (71.4%), which was stage IV at diagnosis in 57.6%. Median overall survival (OS) for the entire population was 24.0 months, with a 1- and 2-year survival rate of 70.7% and 50.0% respectively. Median OS in patients with small-cell lung cancer was 18.8 months versus 25.0 months in patients with NSCLC (p = 0.011). Lung cancer appears to be a biologically different disease in women. By collecting prospective information about characteristics of women with lung cancer attending university hospitals in Spain, we hope to highlight the need to develop strategies based on gender differences and influence future healthcare policy.
