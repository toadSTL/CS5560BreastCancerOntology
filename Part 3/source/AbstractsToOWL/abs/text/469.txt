Since breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in women and the second most common cause of cancer death in women, it is important to understand potential sites of metastasis, including rare sites that have not frequently been reported in the literature. As our cancer interventions improve, patients will live longer and we will potentially see unusual patterns of metastatic disease more frequently, as in our case of a woman with breast cancer metastasis to her urinary bladder.
