Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a relatively rare malignancy of the exocrine pancreas. BRCA2, a cancer susceptibility gene, has been widely studied in breast and ovarian carcinomas as mutation carriers for this gene are at a high risk for cancer development. Olaparib, an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer with any BRCA 1/2 mutations. Herein, we report the first case of a germline BRCA2-mutated unresectable advanced PACC patient who responded well to olaparib treatment.
