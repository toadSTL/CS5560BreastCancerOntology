In recent study, microRNAs have various important functions in diverse biological processes and progression of cancer. In human breast cancer, microRNA-22 has been reported to be downregulated. However, molecular mechanism of microRNA-22 in breast cancer progression and chemosensitivity has not been well studied. In our study, these results demonstrated that microRNA-22 expression levels were significantly reduced in 40 pairs of human breast cancer tissues when compared to normal tissues. Enforced expression of microRNA-22 inhibited activity of cell proliferation and cell migration in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, microRNA-22 targeted NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS) in breast cancer cells. The expression levels of NRAS in human clinical specimens were higher in breast cancer tissues when compared to normal tissues. Moreover, microRNA-22 sensitized breast cancer cells to paclitaxel by regulation of NRAS. Our results then demonstrated that microRNA-22 functioned as a tumor suppressor microRNA and indicated potential application for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the future.
