Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is an inflammatory breast disease with unknown etiology and nonspecific symptoms. Differentiation of breast cancer from granulomatous disease is a diagnostic and clinical challenge. Imaging features and decision of the surgeon, based on these findings, may be important steps during diagnosis and follow-up period. Articles in association with imaging of IGM were evaluated using a PubMed search in August, 2017. Hypo-echoic or heterogeneous mass/es with or without tubular extensions were the most common ultrasonographic findings. Focal asymmetric density with or without skin thickening and parenchymal distortion were detected in most of the patients during mammography. Magnetic resonance imaging most commonly revealed focal or diffuse asymmetrical signal intensity changes without significant mass effect. Although a specified and standardised criteria list for each type of the imaging modality has been lacking, the most commonly detected imaging findings, especially in cases of multiple lesions in accordance with the decision of the surgeon and/or clinician, can be used for the diagnosis and follow-up of IGM with acceptable safety margins. However, in the presence of any suspicious findings during imaging or clinical examination, histopathological analysis should be performed.
