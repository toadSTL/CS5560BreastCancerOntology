Hematological tumors arising in the breast are uncommon and require different treatment modalities dependent upon tumor type. Current treatment options include surgical excision, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Management of these breast malignancies are poorly outlined in the literature. The purpose of this case series is to report five cases consisting of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and extramedullary plasmacytoma occurring in the breast. The cases illustrate heterogeneous radiologic findings and varying management approaches to these tumors. The case series underscores the importance of having a wide differential at diagnosis and recognizes management of disease should be taken on an individual basis with consideration of prognosis and first-line treatment options.
