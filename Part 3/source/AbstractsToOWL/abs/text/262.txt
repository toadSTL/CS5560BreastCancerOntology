Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10-20% of all diagnosed BCs and it is enriched in BRCA1 mutation. Guidelines for Western countries suggest that BRCA 1/2 genetic testing should be done for patients with TNBC diagnosed less than 60 years, but there is lack of evidence supporting genetic testing in Asian populations. We determined the prevalence of germline BRCA 1/2 mutations among unselected Korean patients with TNBC and analyzed oncologic outcomes.
