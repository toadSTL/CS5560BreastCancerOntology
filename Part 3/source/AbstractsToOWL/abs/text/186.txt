Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is a major pathway of mammalian DNA repair that is associated with drug resistance and has not been well characterized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The objective of this study was to explore the role of NER in relapsed ALL patients. We hypothesized that increased expression of NER genes was associated with drug resistance and relapse in ALL.
