MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) show great promise as novel cancer biomarkers. Several studies have revealed an association between abnormal miRNA expression and the risk of various cancer types. However, the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of miRNAs remains unclear. The present meta-analysis was performed to summarize the overall diagnostic performance of miR-195 for cancer. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for associated literature published until December 10, 2017. Eligible studies were selected using multiple search strategies based on study selection criteria. Measures, including sensitivity and specificity, of the performance of miR-195 as a cancer diagnostic tool were pooled using bivariate meta-analysis models. All analyses were performed using Stata 14.0. The pooled analysis included 8 studies comprising 735 cases and 547 controls. The pooled diagnostic results calculated from all studies were as follows: Sensitivity, 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-0.87]; specificity, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.68-0.93); positive likelihood ratio, 4.9 (95% CI, 2.50-9.50); negative likelihood ratio, 0.25 (95% CI, 0.18-0.35); diagnostic odds ratio, 20 (95% CI, 10.00-38.00); and area under the curve, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.90). Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test suggested no potential publication bias (P=0.53). The present meta-analysis indicated that miR-195 could be a reliable non-invasive biomarker for the diagnosis of cancer. Further large-scale prospective studies are necessary to confirm the present findings and the clinical value of miR-195 for future diagnostics.
