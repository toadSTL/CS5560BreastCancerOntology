A series of new benzothiazole-based carbamates and amides were synthesized and their antiproliferative activity was determined. Derivatives with profound activity were identified and further investigated for their possible mechanism of action. It was found that these compounds induce specific apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest and decrease ROS level in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Moreover, submicromolar antiproliferative activity of examined carbamates against NT2/D1 testicular embryonal carcinoma was shown. The most potent derivatives strongly inhibited NT2/D1 cell migration and invasiveness.
