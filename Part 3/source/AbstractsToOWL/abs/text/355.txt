Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of highly malignant breast cancer with poor prognosis. Growing evidence indicates that Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in the development and progression of a variety of cancers including breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.
