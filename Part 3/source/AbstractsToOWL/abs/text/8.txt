Medical out-of-pocket costs paid by patients can be problematic when it adversely affects access to care. Survey research involving patients with out-of-pocket expenses may have selection biases, so accurate estimates are unknown. During 2010-11, 419 participants from the QSkin Sun and Health Study (n=43794) had a confirmed diagnosis of either melanoma, prostate, breast, colorectal or lung cancer. These were matched to a general population group (n=421) and a group of high users of GP services (n=419). Medical fees charged and out-of-pocket medical expenses for Medicare services were analysed. Over 2 years, three-quarters of individuals with cancer paid up-front provider fees of up to A$20551 compared with A$10995 for the high GP user group and A$6394 for the general population group. Out-of-pocket expenses were significantly higher for those with cancer (mean A$3514) compared with the high GP-user group (mean A$1837) and general population group (A$1245). Highest expenses were for therapeutic procedures (mean A$2062). Older individuals, those with poor perceived health or private health insurance had the highest costs. Regardless of private insurance status, patients with one of the main five cancers pay significantly higher out-of-pocket costs for health care compared with those without cancer.
