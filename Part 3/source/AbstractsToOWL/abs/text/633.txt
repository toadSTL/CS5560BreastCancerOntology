Recently, the development of ultrasonography (US)-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) has enabled the excision of benign breast tumors with normal surrounding breast tissues; thus, complete excision is possible without residual tumor tissue. We sought to identify the clinicopathological characteristics and recurrence rates of benign phyllodes tumors diagnosed by US-guided VABB.
