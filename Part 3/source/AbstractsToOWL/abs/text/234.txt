Spontaneously occurring canine mammary tumours (CMTs) are the most common neoplasms of female unspayed dogs and are of potential importance as models for human breast cancer as well. Mortality rates are thrice higher in dogs as compared to humans with breast cancer, which can partly be attributed to lack of diagnostic techniques for their early detection. Human breast cancer studies reveal role of autoantibodies in early cancer diagnosis and also the usefulness of autoantibody panels in increasing the sensitivity, as well as, specificity of diagnostic assays. Therefore, in this study, we took advantage of high-throughput Luminex technique for developing a multiplex assay to detect autoantibody signatures against 5 canine mammary tumour-associated autoantigens (TAAs). These TAAs were expressed separately as fusion proteins with halo tag at the N-terminus, which allows easy and specific covalent coupling with magnetic microspheres. The multiplex assay, comprising a panel of candidate autoantigens (TPI, PGAM1, MNSOD, CMYC & MUC1) was used for screening circulating autoantibodies in 125 dog sera samples, including 75 mammary tumour sera and 50 healthy dog sera. The area under curve (AUC) of the combined panel of biomarkers is 0.931 (p < 0.0001), which validates the discriminative potential of the panel in differentiating tumour patients from healthy controls. The assay could be conducted in 3hrs using only 1ul of serum sample and could detect clinical cases of canine mammary tumour with sensitivity and specificity of 78.6% and 90%, respectively. In this study, we report for the first time a multiplexed assay for detection of autoantibodies in canine tumours, utilizing luminex technology and halo-tag coupling strategy. Further to the best of our knowledge, autoantibodies to CMYC and MUC1 have been reported for the first time in canines in this study.
