Much effort has been devoted to targeting agents for imaging and chemotherapy of tumors in cancer research, but there remain significant unmet needs in that area. We have reported a series of preclinical TrkC targeting agents for diagnoses and treatment of metastatic breast cancer; however, with respect to optical imaging, there are limitations to the agents already disclosed. In this work, a TrkC targeting fragment was equipped with a zwitterionic cyanine dye to give a near-infrared probe for
