Discerning the relationship between molecules involved in diseases based on their underlying biological mechanisms is one of the greatest challenges in therapeutic development today. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications during pregnancy, which adversely affects both mothers and offspring during and after pregnancy. We have constructed two datasets of (GDM associated genes from affected mother and placenta to systematically analyze and evaluate their interactions like gene-gene, gene-protein, gene-microRNA (miRNA), gene-transcription factors, and gene-associated diseases to enhance our current knowledge, which may lead to further advancements in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The results identify the key genes with respect to maternal dataset as insulin receptor, insulin (INS), leptin (LEP), glucokinase, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, whereas from placenta include insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone receptor, and breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 1, which are found to be highly enriched in pancreas, ovary, adipocyte, heart, and placental tissues. The key transcription factors include Sp1 transcription factor, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, whereas miRNA includes has-miR-5699-5p and has-miR-3158-3p. The study also reveals that GDM has associations with diseases like type I and II diabetes mellitus, obesity, and preeclampsia. More significantly, we could trace out a significant connection between the key molecules like LEP and placental growth hormone from mother and placental dataset, which plays a critical role in INS secretion, INS signaling, and Î²-cell dysfunction pathways.
