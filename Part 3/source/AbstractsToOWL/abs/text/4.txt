The fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene on chromosome 16q12.2 shows an intimate association with obesity and body mass index. Recently, research into the FTO gene and its expression product has attracted widespread interest due to the identification of FTO as an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase. FTO primarily regulates the m6A levels of downstream targets via their 3' untranslated regions. FTO not only plays a critical role in obesity-related diseases but also is involved in the occurrence, development and prognosis of many types of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukaemia, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Currently, studies indicate that FTO is a crucial component of m6A modification, it regulates cancer stem cell function, and promotes the growth, self-renewal and metastasis of cancer cells. In this review, we summarized and analysed the data regarding the structural features and biological functions of FTO as well as its association with different cancers and possible molecular mechanisms.
