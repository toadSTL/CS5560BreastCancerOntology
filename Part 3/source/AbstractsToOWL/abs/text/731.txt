Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed abundant long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have been characterized as critical components of cancer biology in humans. The present study aims to investigate the role of the lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in breast cancer (BRCA) as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms and functions of KCNQ1OT1 involved in the progression of BRCA.
