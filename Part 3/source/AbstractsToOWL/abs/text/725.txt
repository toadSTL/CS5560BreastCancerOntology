Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The incidence of breast has been increasing in most regions of the world. Regular breast self-examination is one of the most cost-effective methods for early detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Despite this fact, breast self-examination practice remains low in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess breast self-examination practice and associated factors among women aged 20-70Â years attending public health institutions of Adwa town, North Ethiopia.
