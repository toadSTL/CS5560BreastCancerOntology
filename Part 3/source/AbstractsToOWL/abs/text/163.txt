Phyllodes tumors (PT) of the breast are uncommon fibroepithelial neoplasms with potential to recur and metastasize. Apart from histologic grading, the expression of biologic markers and its relationship with tumor behavior have been a topic of interest. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ AKT pathway regulates diverse biologic functions and is one of most frequently deregulated pathways in cancers. Little is known of PI3K/AKT pathway alteration in PT METHODS: This study investigated the expression of four biologic markers involved in this pathway (PTEN, INPP4B, PI3KCA and pAKT) in 134 PTs by immunohistochemistry RESULTS: Using an immunoscore incorporating staining intensity and proportion, a low epithelial INPP4B (p=0.045) was associated with recurrence. A trend was found with low epithelial PTEN (p=0.090). Interestingly, a low epithelial INPP4B was also associated with recurred tumor (p=0.043). Stromal PI3KCA (p=0.016) and pAKT (p=0.006) expression were found to be correlated with increased histologic grading but an opposite trend for stromal INPP4B (p=0.018). In addition, epithelial and stromal PTEN, PI3KCA and pAKT expression showed strong correlation with each other (p â‰¤0.001) CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the alterations in AKT pathway activation may correlate with malignant transformation and recurrence in PT. Low epithelial INPP4B/PTEN expression is associated with shorter RFS. These observations suggest that the pathway may play a crucial part in the biological behavior and progression of PT, and assessing the expression of this pathway may be of value in the diagnosis, grading, prognostication and management This article is protected by copyright.
