Cutaneous metastatic breast cancer is the most common cutaneous metastatic malignancy in women. The assessment of cutaneous metastatic disease can be perplexing because the clinical presentation appears similar to other skin malignancies like angiosarcoma or melanoma, or benign diseases like cellulitis and lymphedema. To date, only a limited number of dermoscopic images of cutaneous metastatic solid tumors, especially breast cancer, have been published.
