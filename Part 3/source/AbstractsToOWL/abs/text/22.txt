Multiple primary malignant tumors (MPMT) refers to the presence of two or more primary cancers of different organs in the same patient. MPMT is a sparse disease in the past, but there has been a gradual increase in the morbidity. Since multiple primary malignant tumors treatment methods differ, it is essential for clinicians to be able to distinguish between separate primary lesions and metastasis.
