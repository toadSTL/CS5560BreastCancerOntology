Molecular imaging of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) pathway-activated system serves the basis of ER+ disease management such as cancers and endometriosis. ER+ patients have better response to endocrine therapy and survive twice as long as negative ER patients. However, tumor resistance resulting from clinical used aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens is unpredictable. Radiolabeled ER+ ligand could quantify ER+ tissue uptake which helps to stage and restage of the cancer as well as endometriosis. The differential diagnosis of ER+ lesions by using a labeled ligand helps to select the patients for optimal response to endocrine therapy and to discontinue the treatment when resistance occurs. In addition, radiolabeled ER+ ligand serves as basis for image-guided response follow-up. Glutamate receptors are cell surface receptors which are overexpressed in inflammation and infection. Using glutamate peptide as a drug carrier helps to target intracellular genes via glutamate receptor-mediated process. Reports have shown that polyglutamate is a drug carrier that could alter drug solubility and enhance estrogen receptor-ligand binding pocket. However, polyglutamate was a blend of mixed polymer with a wide range of molecular weight. Thus, the structural confirmation and purity of the conjugates were not optimized. To overcome this problem, the efficient synthesis of glutamate peptide-estradiol (GAP-EDL) conjugate was achieved with high purity. EDL was conjugated site-specific at the first glutamate of GAP. The average cell uptake of
