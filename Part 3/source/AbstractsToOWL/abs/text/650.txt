Cancer is considered as a challenging lethal agent around the world and its detection at early stages would help prevention of the high mortality. Among the widely used biomarkers in clinical diagnosis of cancer, extracellular non-coding RNAs as ribonucleic acid biomarkers serve as state-of-the-art candidates for molecular diagnosis. In that regard, microRNAs are of great priority mainly because of high variety and stability in body fluids. Accordingly, common miRNAs among most prevalent cancers could help us (pre)diagnose cancer with high accuracy in target samples. In this study, common lethal cancers to humans were investigated in case of miRNA profiles to determine the possible common correlation between miRNA up-regulation or down-regulation (as a ribonucleic acid biomarker) and developing the cancers. It was shown that among the investigated miRNAs, five typical extracellular miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-21, miR-155, miR-221, and miR-375) dysregulation are predominant in most cancer varieties comprising breast, colon, lung, prostate, pancreas, gastric, ovarian, esophagus and liver. This could serve as an appropriate target site for developing point-of-care approaches for cancer detection e.g. designing diagnostic biosensor-based microarrays or kits for both quantification and qualification of the biomarkers. Besides, the miRNA candidates could be efficiently applied to cancer therapeutic approaches.
