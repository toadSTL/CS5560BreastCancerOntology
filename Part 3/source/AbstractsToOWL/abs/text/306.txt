In North America and Europe, return-to-work (RTW) rates vary among breast cancer (BC) survivors, from 24% to 66% and from 53% to 82% at 6 and 36 months after diagnosis, respectively. To date, there is a lack of data on RTW rates after BC diagnosis in Latin America. Therefore, the primary objectives of this study were to define RTW rates at 12 and 24 months after BC diagnosis and to identify the factors associated with RTW in this population.
