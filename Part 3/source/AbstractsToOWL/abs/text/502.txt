Black women are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage of breast cancer in part due to barriers to timely screening mammography, resulting in poorer mortality and survival outcomes.

However, the ability to recognize and seek help to overcome barriers may be affected by gendered and racialized social expectations of women.
