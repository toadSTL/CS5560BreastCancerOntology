Polymerase δ catalytic subunit gene 1 (POLD1) may serve an important function in the development of tumors. However, its role in breast cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to observe the expression and the function of POLD1 in breast cancer. A total of 84 patients with invasive breast carcinoma were recruited between 2011 and 2013. The expression of POLD1 was detected in paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Gene expression level of POLD1 was assessed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of POLD1 was assessed using western blot analysis. The association between the clinicopathological features of patients with breast cancer and POLD1 expression was analyzed using a χ
