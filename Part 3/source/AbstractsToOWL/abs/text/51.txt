Breast cancer diagnosis has been mostly accomplished by imaging technologies. These methods have the great advantages of detecting the presence and location of breast cancer. However, it's difficult to distinguish between a benign and malignant tumor in a deep position because both tumor types look similar. In this paper, we vibrated the tissue including tumor from skin with a compression cylinder to analyze the frequency difference for distinguishing the tissue type. Before distinguishing a benign and malignant tumor, it's necessary to validate to distinguish between normal tissue and tumor. The objective is to validate the feasibility of using a compression cylinder that emphasizes the differences in frequency between normal tissue and tumor. In two experiments, we measured the displacement on the surface of a breast phantom vibrated by an impulse hammer. We compared the frequency difference with and without a cylinder. We also studied the frequency changes in the relationship between tumor and cylinder position. We found a 5.0 Hz difference in compliance between normal tissue and the simulated tumor using a compression cylinder. The difference in frequency correlated negatively with distance from the simulated tumor to a compression cylinder. We concluded that a compression cylinder would enhance the frequency difference between normal tissue and a simulated tumor with appropriate configuration.
