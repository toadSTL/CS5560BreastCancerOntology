Primary endocrine therapy (PET) is a treatment option for elderly patients with ER-positive breast cancer enabling frail patients to avoid surgery. As a long-term treatment option, it has been shown to be inferior to surgery in controlling local disease. Decision-making in these patients is crucial in avoiding treatment failure. We examined the influence of decision-making on outcomes of PET failure as a secondary analysis as part of a large observational study.
