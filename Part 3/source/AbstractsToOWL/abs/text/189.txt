Many outcomes derived from electronic health records (EHR) not only are imperfect but also may suffer from exposure-dependent differential misclassification due to variability in the quality and availability of EHR data across exposure groups. The objective of this study was to quantify the inflation of type I error rates that can result from differential outcome misclassification.
