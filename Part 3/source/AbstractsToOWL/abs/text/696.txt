Identification of specific and reliable biomarkers or unique characteristics is significant for cancer molecular diagnosis and cancer therapeutic assessment. As a biomarker, sialic acid expression in human biofluid or on cell surface is one of interest to determine the tumor malignancy and metastasis since it involves in many crucial metabolic processes. In this work, we aimed to develop a molecular diagnosis method to make it possible to distinguish human breast cancer and normal tissues by capturing rich spectral features of phenyboronic acid-based nanoprobe (MPBA@AgNP) when it binds to sialic acid on cell surface. We analyzed and found that the marker bands at 1074 and 1570â€¯cm
