The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program seeks to reduce health care disparities by providing uninsured and underinsured women access to screening mammograms. The objective of this study is to identify the differences in presentation, surgical management, and mortality among nonmetastatic uninsured patients diagnosed through Indiana's Breast and Cervical Cancer Program compared with patients with private and government (Medicare or Medicaid) insurance.
