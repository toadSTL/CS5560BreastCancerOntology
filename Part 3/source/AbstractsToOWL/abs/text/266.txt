Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. Long-term survivors among patients treated for breast cancer are at a high risk for developing a second primary malignancy. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary hepatic malignancy and should be ruled out in breast cancer patients who are diagnosed with solitary hepatic lesions. False diagnosis may lead to inappropriate oncologic staging and treatment of the disease.
