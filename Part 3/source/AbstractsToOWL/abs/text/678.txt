Emerging evidences have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in the development and progression of cancers. Dysregulation of lncRNA MIR31HG has recently been reported in several types of cancers, and researches on the function of MIR31HG in cancers suggested that MIR31HG could act as either oncogene or tumor suppressor. But the functional involvement of MIR31HG has not been studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
