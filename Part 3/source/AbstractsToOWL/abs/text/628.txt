The Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) atlas defines category 5 assessments as appropriate only for lesions that are almost certainly cancer, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of â‰¥95%. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of classifying lesions at diagnostic breast imaging with sufficiently high PPV to merit category 5 assessments, and to identify those lesion descriptors that yield such a high PPV.
