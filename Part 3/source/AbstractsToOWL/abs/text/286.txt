The incidence of superior vena cava syndrome within the United States is roughly 15,000 cases per year. Superior vena cava syndrome is a potentially life-threatening medical condition; however, superior vena cava syndrome is not fatal in the majority of cases. Superior vena cava syndrome encompasses a collection of signs and symptoms resulting from obstruction of the superior vena cava, including swelling of the upper body of the head, neck, arms, and/or breast. It is also associated with cyanosis, plethora, and distended subcutaneous vessels. Lung cancer, including both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer, is the most common extrinsic cause of superior vena cava syndrome. Intrinsic disruption of superior vena cava flow can also precipitate superior vena cava syndrome. This case report describes an unusual presentation and potential etiology of superior vena cava syndrome.
