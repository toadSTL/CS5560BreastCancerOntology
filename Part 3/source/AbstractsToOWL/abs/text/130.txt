The significance of this study lies in the importance of (1) nondestructive testing in defect studies and (2) securing the reliability of breast cancer prediction through thermal analysis in nondestructive testing. Most nondestructive tests have negative effects on the human body. Moreover, the precision and accuracy of such tests are poor. This study analyzes these drawbacks and increases the reliability of such methods. A theoretical model was constructed, by which simulated inner breast tissue was observed in a nondestructive way through thermal analysis, and the presence and extent of simulated breast cancer were estimated based on the thermal observations. Herein, we studied the medical diagnosis of breast cancer by creating a theoretical environment that simulated breast cancer in a real-world setting; the model used two-dimensional modeling and partial differential equation (PDE) thermal analysis. Our theoretical analysis, based on partial differential equations, allowed us to demonstrate that non-wounding defect detection is possible and, in many ways, preferable. The main contribution of this paper lies in studying long-term estimates. In addition, the model in this study can be extended to predict breast cancer through pure heat and can also be used for various other cancer and tumor analyses in the human body.
