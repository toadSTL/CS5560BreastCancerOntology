Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in our country and it is usually diagnosed in the early and potentially curable stages. Nevertheless, around 20-30% of patients will relapse despite appropriate locoregional and systemic therapies. A better knowledge of this disease is improving our ability to select the most appropriate therapy for each patient with a recent diagnosis of an early stage breast cancer, minimizing unnecessary toxicities and improving long-term efficacy.
