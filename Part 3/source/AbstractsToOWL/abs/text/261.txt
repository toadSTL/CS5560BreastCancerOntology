In this work, a bio-metal-organic framework (Bio-MOF) coated with a monodispersed layer of chitosan (CS; CS/Bio-MOF) was synthesized and applied as a pH-responsive and target-selective system for delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) in the treatment of breast cancer. The efficiency of the nanocarrier in loading and releasing DOX was assessed at different pH levels. To monitor the in vitro drug release behavior of the drug-loaded carrier, the carrier was immersed in a phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) at 37 Â°C. According to the observations, the nanocarrier presents a slow and continuous release profile as well as a noticeable drug loading capacity. In addition, the carrier demonstrates a pH-responsive and target-selective behavior by releasing a high amount of DOX at pH 6.8, which is indicative of tumor cells and inflamed tissues and releasing a substantially lower amount of DOX at higher pH values. In addition, the results indicated that pH is effective on DOX uptake by CS/Bio-MOF. A 3.6 mg amount of DOX was loaded into 10 mg of CS/Bio-MOF, resulting in a 21.7% removal at pH 7.4 and 93.0% at pH 6.8. The collapsing and swelling of the CS layers coated on the surface of the Bio-MOFs were found to be responsible for the observed pH dependence of DOX delivery. Moreover, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the trypan blue test were performed on the MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line in the presence of the CS/Bio-MOF carrier to confirm its biological compatibility. In addition, Annexin V staining was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the free and loaded DOX molecules. On the basis of the obtained optical microscopy, MTT assay, fluorescence microscopy, and dyeing results, the CS/Bio-MOF carrier greatly enhances cellular uptake of the drug by the MCF-7 cells and, therefore, apoptosis of the cells due to its biocompatibility and pH-responsive behavior.
