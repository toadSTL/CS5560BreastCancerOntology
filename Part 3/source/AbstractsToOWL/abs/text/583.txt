Early detection of lymphedema gives an opportunity for effective and successful treatment of lymphedema. However, the current diagnosis methods, except the bioimpedance analysis, perometry, and indocyanine green lymphography, have limitations in detecting early stage lymphedema. Sonoelastography is a diagnostic ultrasound technique that provides an opportunity to estimate soft tissue stiffness. Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a brand new elastography technique. Unlike strain elastography, this method is conducted automatically, that is, independently of user's manual tissue compression. The aim of this study is to establish the role of sonoelastography in diagnosis and staging of lymphedema by using the SWE technique in lymphedema patients.
