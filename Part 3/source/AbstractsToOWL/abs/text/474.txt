In Chinese women, breast and colorectal cancers are highly prevalent. In the early stage, the primary treatment for these cancers is surgical resection.

Although synchronous breast and rectal cancer is uncommon, estimating recurrence risk is even more challenging in patients with two histologically distinct malignancies.
