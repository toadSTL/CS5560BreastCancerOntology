Ceased retrieving further abstracts.

Need to replace contents of 135.xml with something containing abstract tag to progress towards "1000" abstract search results.

Currently fielding results of abstracts from PubMedIDs594.xt (it was a typo)

PubMedIDs for removal is list of pub med Ids whos abstracts include "Background:"

PubMedIDs68.txt has solid PubMedIDs (and the abstracts from these could be used for Lab3?/Ontology Creation?)
