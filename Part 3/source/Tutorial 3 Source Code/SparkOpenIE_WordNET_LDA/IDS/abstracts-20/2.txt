BACKGROUND: Despite a trend for less radical surgical approaches in breast cancer due to better understanding of tumour biology and new treatment options such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT), seroma production remains one of the main surgical side effects that can result in prolonged recovery, delay of radiotherapy and patient discomfort. The aim of this study is to provide an update on risk factors for seroma production after breast cancer surgery considering the latest treatment options.
