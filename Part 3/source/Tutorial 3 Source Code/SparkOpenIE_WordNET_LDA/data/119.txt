Breast cancer ranks among the most common adult cancers in Kenya. Individuals with a family history of the disease are at increased risk.

Genetic testing and counseling can help patients understand their risk and assist clinicians in choosing therapies. We aimed to uncover what patients know, experience, and think with regard to breast cancer genetics in Kenya.
