A third of new cases of breast cancer could be detected early, which would prevent more serious consequences, such as mastectomy and death. Access to the subjectivity of mastectomized patients becomes relevant to elucidate failures in early detection of breast cancer and thus improve the cancer care network. Given that, the present study aimed to identify mastectomized women's perception of the quality of care provided by the cancer care network for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
