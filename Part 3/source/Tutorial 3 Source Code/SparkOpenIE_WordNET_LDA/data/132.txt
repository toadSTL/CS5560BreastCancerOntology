As breast cancer diagnoses increase, so does the number of patients who are critically evaluating hospital attributes to determine where to receive their treatment. Evidence suggests that complex surgeries have better outcomes in high volume academic centers. Whether clinical outcomes of women diagnosed with operable breast cancer, who are treated by multiple disciplines including non-complex surgical approaches, differ for those received all or part of their treatment at their community cancer center is unclear. We hypothesize that the clinical outcomes do not differ for those who received all or part of their care at their community cancer center. Our aim is to analyze data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who received all their treatment at community cancer center when compared with those who had part or all of their care elsewhere.
