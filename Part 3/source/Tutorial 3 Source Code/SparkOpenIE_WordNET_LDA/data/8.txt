The diagnosis of metastasis by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early breast cancer surgery provides an accurate view of the state of metastases to the axillary lymph nodes, and it has now become the standard procedure. In the present study, whether omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is possible by evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) before NAC in cases without metastasis on diagnostic imaging, but with metastasis on SLNB, was retrospectively investigated.
