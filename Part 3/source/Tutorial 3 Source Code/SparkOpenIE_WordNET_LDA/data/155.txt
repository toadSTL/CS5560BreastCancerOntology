The ability to detect breast cancer early in its progression is essential to improve patient survival and quality of life. The noninvasive and dynamic imaging and functional assessments of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα), which is commonly expressed at high levels in breast cancer, are important for effective diagnosis and treatment. Hence, the development of a specific ERα-targeted probe is a major research goal. To that end, in the present study, we created a novel near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, IRDye800CW-E
