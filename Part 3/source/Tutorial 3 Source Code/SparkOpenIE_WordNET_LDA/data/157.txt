Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and represents one of the top five leading causes of cancer-related mortality. Inherited and acquired genetic mutations as well as epigenetic aberrations are known to be important contributors to the development and progression of breast cancer. Recent developments in high-throughput technologies have increased our understanding of the molecular changes in breast cancer, leading to the identification of distinctive genetic and epigenetic modifications in different breast cancer molecular subtypes. These genetic and epigenetic changes in luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2/HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like breast cancer subtypes are discussed in this chapter. Furthermore, recent epigenome studies provided more information about further stratification of breast cancer subtypes, with essential role in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Thus, the inclusion of both genetic and epigenetic information in breast cancer clinical care could provide critical scientific base for precision medicine in breast cancer.
