Breast cancer affected 1.7 million people worldwide in 2012 and accounts for approximately 23.3Â % of all cancers diagnosed in women. The disease is characterized by a genetic mutation, either inherited or resulting from environmental factors, that causes uncontrollable cellular growth of breast tissue or adjacent tissues. Current means of diagnosing this disease depend on the individual analyzing the results from bulky, highly technical, and expensive equipment that is not globally accessible. As a result, patients can go undiagnosed due to a lack of available equipment or be over-diagnosed due to human error. This review attempts to highlight current means of diagnosing breast cancer and critically analyze their effectiveness and usefulness in terms of patient survival. An alternative means based on microfluidics biomarker detection is then presented. This method can be considered as a primary screening tool for diagnosing breast cancer based on its robustness, high throughput, low energy requirements, and accessibility to the general public.
