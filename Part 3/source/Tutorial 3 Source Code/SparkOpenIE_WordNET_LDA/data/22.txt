Endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET) via an axillo-breast (ABA), axillary or breast approach (BA) is effective for treatment of unilateral papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). However, several disadvantages still exist, including inconvenience for using endoscopic instruments and poor cosmetic results. Here, we introduced a modified ABA (MABA) to overcome these disadvantages and evaluated its therapeutic outcomes by comparison with conventional BA.Fifty-five patients undergoing ET via MABA (n = 22) or BA (n = 33) for PTMC were retrospectively enrolled between June 2012 and June 2015. Surgical outcomes, including the operation time, blood loss, amount of drainage, number of dissected lymph nodes, complications, cosmetic satisfaction and prognosis (recurrence and survival), were analyzed.The operation time (87.1 ± 9.3 min vs 93.2 ± 8.3 min; P = .014) and drainage tube removal time (4.4 ± 1.0 days vs 5.1 ± 1.1 days; P = .018) were shorter in the MABA group than those in the BA group. There was less postoperative drainage (54.3 ± 35.7 mL vs 137.6 ± 87.0 mL; P < .01) in the MABA group compared with the BA group. No significant differences in the blood loss (15.9 ± 7.5 mL vs 19.2 ± 11.7 mL, P = .243) and the number of dissected lymph nodes (1.8 ± 1.5 vs 2.3 ± 2.1, P = .309) were observed between the 2 groups. Subcutaneous ecchymosis occurred more frequently in the BA group than that in the MABA group (33.3% vs 9.1%; P = .038). Patients treated by MABA were more satisfied with their cosmetic results than those undergoing BA (100% vs 81.8%; P = .034). At the last follow-up time, all patients were alive although 1 patient in the BA group developed cervical lymph node recurrence ipsilateral to the original tumor at 4 years after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed MABA surgery was a protective factor for postoperative complications (OR = 0.209, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.054-0.817, P = .024).ET via the MABA strategy may be a good choice for unilateral PTMC because of shorter operation time, fewer complications, greater cosmetic satisfaction, and excellent prognosis.
