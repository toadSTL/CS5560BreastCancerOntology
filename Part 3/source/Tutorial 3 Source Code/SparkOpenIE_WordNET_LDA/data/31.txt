Co-existence of meningioma and breast carcinoma metastasis in the type of collision tumor is uncommon in the brain. A 65-year-old female with a history of breast carcinoma suffered from a mass in posterior fossa of brain. After a craniotomy, the pathological specimen showed a collision tumor with breast cancer metastasis and meningioma. In the clinical setting of previously vague diagnosis in imaging, craniotomy for removal of the mass is more recommended if conditions permit. Only the rare tumor is identified in pathology for further follow-up and research.
