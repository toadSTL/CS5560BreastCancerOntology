Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide and depression and anxiety are disturbing side effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of physical activity in global health, quality of life (QoL), and psychological factors (depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and anxiety) in breast cancer survivors after completing cancer treatment and through survivorship. Demographic variables (marital status, education, income), medical status (cancer stage), and level of physical activity (metabolic equivalent of task [MET]) were tested as predictors of depressive mood, anxiety, self-esteem, and QoL in younger and older breast cancer survivors.
