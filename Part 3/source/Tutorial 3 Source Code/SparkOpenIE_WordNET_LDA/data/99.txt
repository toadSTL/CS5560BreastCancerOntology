Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group of malignant neoplasia with poor outcome. Currently, the lack of effective therapy has fostered a major effort to discover new targets to treat this malignant cancer. Here we identified the RON receptor tyrosine kinase as a therapeutic target for potential TNBC treatment. We analyzed RON expression in 168 primary TNBC samples via tissue microarray using anti-RON immunohistochemical staining and demonstrated that RON was widely expressed in 76.8 % TNBC samples with overexpression in 76 cases (45.2%). These results provide the molecular basis to target RON for TNBC therapy. To this end, anti-RON monoclonal antibody Zt/g4-drug monomethyl auristatin E conjugate (Zt/g4-MMAE) was developed with a drug to antibody ratio of 3.29 and tested in a panel of TNBC cell lines with different phenotypes. In vitro, Zt/g4-MMAE rapidly induced RON internalization, resulted in cell cycle arrest followed by massive cell death. The calculated IC50 values ranged from 0.06 to 3.46 Âµg per ml dependent on individual TNBC cell lines tested. Zt/g4-MMAE also effectively killed TNBC stem-like cells with RON+/CD44+/CD24- phenotypes and RON-negative TNBC cells through the bystander effect. In vivo, Zt/g4-MMAE at 10 mg/kg in a Q12 x 2 regimen completely eradicated TNBC xenografts without the regrowth of xenograft tumors. In conclusion, increased RON expression is a pathogenic feature in primary TNBC samples. Zt/g4-MMAE is highly effective in eradicating TNBC xenografts in preclinical models. These findings lay the foundation for using anti-RON Zt/g4-MMAE in clinical trials as a novel strategy for TNBC treatment.
