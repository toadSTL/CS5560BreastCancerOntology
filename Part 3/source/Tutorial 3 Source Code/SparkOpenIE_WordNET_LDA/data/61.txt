Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard in breast cancer staging, but it is costly and time-consuming. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) under ultrasonographic guidance identifies patients who need axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND), thus reducing costs. As an alternative to frozen sections (FS), intraoperative scrape cytology (ISC) for SLNB is an inexpensive, rapid, accurate and safe technique. We evaluated the synergy of FNAC and SLNB in determining the axillary burden and the performance of the ISC method.
