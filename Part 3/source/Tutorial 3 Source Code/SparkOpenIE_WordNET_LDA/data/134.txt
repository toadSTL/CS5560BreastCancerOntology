Protocadherin-10 (PCDH10) is a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression level is downregulated by promoter methylation in certain types of human tumors. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression level and promoter methylation status of PCDH10 in breast cancer cells and to evaluate the association of PCDH10 methylation and tumor progression and prognosis. MethyLight was used to detect the methylation status of PCDH10 in breast cancer tissues and healthy breast tissues. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the mRNA expression level of PCDH10, as well as to evaluate the association between PCDH10 methylation and clinicopathological features, along with patients' overall survival (OS). PCDH10 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) methylated sites were identified in tumor tissues and matched healthy tissues (n=392). Tumor tissues and matched healthy tissues exhibited identifiable PCR results, with PCDH10 gene promoter methylation identified in ductal carcinoma
