Evaluation and management of dermatologic diseases of the breast and nipple requires an understanding of the unique anatomy of the breast and nipple as well as an awareness of the significant emotional, cultural, and sexual considerations that may come into play when treating this anatomic area. Part I of this 2 Part CME Series reviews breast anatomy, congenital breast anomalies, and benign and malignant breast tumors. Specifically, an emphasis is placed on inflammatory breast cancer and breast cancer with non-inflammatory skin involvement as well as on cutaneous metastases to the breast and from breast cancer. Familiarity of the dermatologist with the cutaneous manifestations of breast cancer will facilitate the diagnosis of breast malignancy and assist with staging, prognostication, and evaluation for recurrence. This article also discusses genodermatoses that predispose to breast pathology and provides imaging recommendations for evaluating a palpable breast mass.
