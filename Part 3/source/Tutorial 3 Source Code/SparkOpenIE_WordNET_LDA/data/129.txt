Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and known as a typical woman's disease. This study is part of the N-MALE project (Male breast cancer: patient's needs in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and follow-up-care) and aims to investigate how MBC patients (MBCP) feel about suffering from a "woman's disease," what character the stigmatization has, and how it can be prospectively reduced. Therefore, a mixed methods design is applied including data of N = 27 qualitative interviews with MBCP and quantitative data of N = 100 MBCP. Findings identify a diverse picture, as stigmatization varies between contexts and patients: Most stigmatization concentrates on sexual stigmatization and ignorance of MBC and mostly occurs in cancer care systems and work-related contexts. The level of stigmatization varies with age and amount of treatment methods received, as reported within the created typology of different MBCP stigma types. To prospectively reduce stigmatization in MBCP, more publicity of MBC is needed, as well as gender-neutral communication and information material.
