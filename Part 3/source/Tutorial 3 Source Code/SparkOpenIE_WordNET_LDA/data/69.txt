Both breast cancer and autoimmune diseases (ADs) are predominant in women. NSAIDs are common medications for AD. Evidence on the association between NSAIDs use and breast cancer risk is controversial. We investigated the association between NSAIDs exposure and breast cancer risk in female patients with AD. AD patients older than 18 years of age were enrolled from Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. The NSAID users were defined as AD patients who had ever taken NSAIDs for at least 3 months between 2000 and 2009. All individuals were followed from the date of first diagnosis of AD to the end of 2013 to evaluate the risk of breast cancer. We estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) using Cox proportional hazard regression after adjusting for age, comorbidities and medications. A total of 12 331 NSAID users and 12 331 non-NSAID users were included in this study after 1 : 1 individual matching. The NSAID users were less likely to develop breast cancer than the non-NSAID users (adjusted HR: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.50; P<0.001), even if they used NSAIDs with low cumulative defined daily doses (adjusted HR: 0.42; 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.53; P<0.001). The incidence of new-onset breast cancer in NSAID users was significantly decreased in users taking selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, diclofenac, ibuprofen and piroxicam. Lower cumulative hazard rates were found in the AD patients who used NSAIDs (P<0.001). NSAID exposure is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in female AD patients.
