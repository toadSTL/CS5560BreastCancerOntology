Infertility affects around 7% of men worldwide. Idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate due to failed spermatogenesis. There is a high probability that NOA is caused by rare genetic defects. In this study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was applied to two Estonian brothers diagnosed with NOA and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS). Compound heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in FANCM (Fanconi anemia complementation group M) were detected as the most likely cause for their condition.
