N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR) is a synthetic retinoid, less toxic than the parent all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Unlike RA, 4-HPR induces apoptosis in tumor cells. Because 4-HPR can hydrolyze to liberate RA, a potent human teratogen, the unhydrolyzable ketone analog of 4-HPR, 4-hydroxybenzylretinone (4-HBR) has been prepared and has been found to cause apoptosis in tumor cells and shrink carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors as 4-HPR does. Herein, we examined the mechanism whereby 4-HPR and 4-HBR induce apoptosis and death in breast cancer cells.
