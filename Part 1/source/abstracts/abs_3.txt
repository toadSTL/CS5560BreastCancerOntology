Women diagnosed with breast cancer younger than 45Â years (young breast cancer survivors-YBCS) and their biological relatives face significant stressors.
Although family support is an important coping resource, little is known about YBCS' and relatives' support and whether it is interdependent.
The study described family support in YBCS and their biological relatives; identified demographic, clinical, and psychosocial predictors of support; and determined the interdependence of support in YBCS-relatives family units.
