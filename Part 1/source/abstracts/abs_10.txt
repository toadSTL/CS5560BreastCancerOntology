Skin metastases from colorectal carcinoma are rare and signal advanced disease.
Skin metastasis refers to growth of cancer cells in the skin originating from an internal cancer.
In most cases, cutaneous metastasis develops after the initial diagnosis of the primary internal malignancy and late in the course of the disease.
In very rare cases, skin metastasis may occur at the same time or before the primary cancer has been discovered and may be the prompt for further thorough investigation.
The incidence of skin metastasis varies but is somewhere between 3-10% in patients with a primary malignant tumor.
Most common ones are melanoma (45%), breast cancer (30%), nasal sinus cancers (20%), cancer of the larynx and cancer of the oral cavity (12%) cases.
Here we present a case of 39-year-old man presented to us with multiple subcutaneous lesions over the chest and forehead.
Fine needle aspiration cytology of skin nodules revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma features.
Further imaging of the abdomen with computed tomography (CT) revealed circumferential narrowing of caecum and ascending colon.
The patient was managed with palliative right hemicolectomy in view of constipation and palliative chemotherapy as systemic treatment.
An extensive review of the English literature did not reveal extensive data on metastatic subcutaneous nodules leading to diagnosis of colon cancer.
