The vitamin D receptor (VDR) endocrine system has emerged as an endogenous pleiotropic biological cell regulator with anti-neoplastic effects on breast, colorectal, and prostatic adenocarcinomas.
We studied the association of gene expression, polymorphisms of VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 genes and serum vitamin D levels as surrogate markers of disease progression in patients with acid reflux, Barrett's esophagus (BE), or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
