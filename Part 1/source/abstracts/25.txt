Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% to 20% of breast cancer cases and is characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptors.
Though TNBC is a highly heterogenic and aggressive disease, TNBC patients have better response to neoadjuvant therapy compared to other breast cancer subtypes.
Nevertheless, patients with residual disease have a very poor prognosis, with higher probability of relapse and lower overall survival in the first years after diagnosis.
TNBC has 6 subtypes with distinct molecular signatures with different prognoses and probably different responses to therapy.
The precise stratification of TNBC is therefore crucial for the development of potent standardized and targeted therapies.
In spite of intensive research into finding new molecular biomarkers and designing personalized therapeutic approaches, BRCA mutational status is the only clinically validated biomarker for personalized therapy in TNBC.
Recent studies have reported several promising biomarkers that are currently being validated through clinical trials.
The objective of this review was to summarize the clinically relevant genetic markers for TNBC that could serve as diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive or could improve personalized therapeutic strategies.
