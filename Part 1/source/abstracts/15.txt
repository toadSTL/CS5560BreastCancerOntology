To assess the feasibility of a team-based prognosis and treatment goal discussion for women living with advanced breast cancer.
Female patients diagnosed with advanced breast cancer (n = 25) participated in a mixed methods study that evaluated the feasibility and effects of a planned and structured prognosis discussion.
Audio analysis of the intervention appointments was conducted to assess intervention feasibility.
Patient self-reports of prognosis related beliefs and treatment preferences were compared across intervention and usual care groups.
Most patients found the T-PAT appointment challenging but worthwhile.
Intervention uptake by clinicians was good, but some fidelity disruptions were noted.
T-PAT participants were more likely to hold realistic beliefs about disease curability after the appointment.
Productive prognosis discussions can be delivered effectively by a practice-based clinical team within a semi-structured patient education appointment.
It was perceived by patients with advanced breast cancer as both valuable and acceptable.
T-PAT clinicians found the intervention easy to deliver.
Regular implementation of T-PAT may help clinicians' build prognosis discussion communication skills.
T-PAT documentation provides valuable information that can be used to tailor ongoing care.
