Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), a small subset of breast cancer cells with stem cell-like properties, are essential in tumor formation, metastasis, resistance to anticancer therapies, and cancer recurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenicity by regulating specific oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, and their roles in BCSCs are becoming apparent. A novel, 3-dimensional (3D), semisolid culture system was established to culture MCF-7 spheroid cells with high percentage of BCSCs. The differences in miRNA expression among the MCF-7 parental cells, BCSC-enriched MCF-7 spheroid cells, and CD44
