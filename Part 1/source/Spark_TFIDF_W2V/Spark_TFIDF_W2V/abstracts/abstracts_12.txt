Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Breast tumorigenesis encompasses both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Among intrinsic aspects, the appearance of DNA variation can cause genetic instability, which may lead to carcinogenesis. Genome-wide association studies have found several potential breast cancer-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many different populations. Among these, seven (rs2046210, rs1219648, rs3817198, rs3803662, rs889312, rs10941679 and rs13281615) have been shown to be significantly associated with breast cancer risk in various populations including those very similar to the Vietnamese. Here, therefore, we have investigated the relationship between these SNPs and breast cancer risk in a Vietnamese population case-control cohort. Real-time PCR high-resolution melt analysis was performed to genotype 300 breast cancer cases and 325 healthy controls, and the association between the seven SNPs and breast cancer risk was determined by analyzing the differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies between case and control groups using R software. While five of the seven showed no association with breast cancer, there was a relationship between the other two SNPs, rs2046210 and rs3803662, and the risk of developing this disease in Vietnamese women. The A allele is the risk allele for both rs2046210 (OR [95% CI] = 1.43 [1.14 - 1.78], P = 0.0015) and rs3803662 (OR [95% CI] = 1.45 [1.16 - 1.83], P = 0.001). We conclude that two polymorphisms, rs2046210 in ESR1 and rs3803662 in TNRC9, are associated with breast cancer risk in the Vietnamese population.
