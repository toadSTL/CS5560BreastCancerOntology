The burden and experiences that come with a breast cancer diagnosis in a family impact how women perceive personal cancer risk and pursue preventive strategies and/or early detection screening. Hence, this study sought to understand how Filipino women incorporate their experiences living with a sister diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer to their personal perceived risk and screening behavior. Guided by phenomenological approach of inquiry, a face-to-face, semi-structured interview was conducted with 12 purposively sampled women with a female sibling diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results revealed that the respondents tend to compare themselves with their sister when constructing views of personal cancer vulnerability. The subjective risk is also shaped by their beliefs regarding cancer causation such as personalistic causes, personal theory of inheritance, and locus of control. Their sisters' cancer diagnoses serve as a motivation for them to perform breast self-examination. However, clinical breast examination and screening mammography are underutilized due to perceived barriers such as difficulty allotting time to medical consultation, fear, and lack of finances. Overall, cancer risk perception and screening behavior are important factors that must be addressed during cancer genetic counseling consultations. Better understanding of these factors will aid in the formulation of an effective management plan for at-risk women.
