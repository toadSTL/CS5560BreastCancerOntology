To assess the feasibility of a team-based prognosis and treatment goal discussion for women living with advanced breast cancer. Female patients diagnosed with advanced breast cancer (n = 25) participated in a mixed methods study that evaluated the feasibility and effects of a planned and structured prognosis discussion. Audio analysis of the intervention appointments was conducted to assess intervention feasibility. Patient self-reports of prognosis related beliefs and treatment preferences were compared across intervention and usual care groups. Most patients found the T-PAT appointment challenging but worthwhile. Intervention uptake by clinicians was good, but some fidelity disruptions were noted. T-PAT participants were more likely to hold realistic beliefs about disease curability after the appointment. Productive prognosis discussions can be delivered effectively by a practice-based clinical team within a semi-structured patient education appointment. It was perceived by patients with advanced breast cancer as both valuable and acceptable. T-PAT clinicians found the intervention easy to deliver. Regular implementation of T-PAT may help clinicians' build prognosis discussion communication skills. T-PAT documentation provides valuable information that can be used to tailor ongoing care.
