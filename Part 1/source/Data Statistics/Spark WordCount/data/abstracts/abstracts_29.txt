Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. In recent years, regulation of genes involved in heparan sulphate (HS) biosynthesis have received increased interest as regulators of breast cancer cell adhesion and invasion. The exostosin (EXT) proteins are glycosyltransferases involved in elongation of HS, a regulator of intracellular signaling, cell-cell interactions, and tissue morphogenesis. The EXT family contains five members: EXT1, EXT2, and three EXT-like (EXTL) members: EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3. While the expression levels of these enzymes change in tumor cells, little is known how this changes the structure and function of HS. In the present study, we investigated gene expression profiles of the EXT family members, their glycosyltransferase activities and HS structure in the estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) positive MCF7 cells, and the ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 epithelial breast carcinoma cell lines. The gene expression profiles for MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 cells were very similar. In both cell lines
