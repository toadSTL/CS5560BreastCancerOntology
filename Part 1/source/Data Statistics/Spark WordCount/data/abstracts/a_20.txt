Objective: Breast Cancer is the most invasive disease and fatal disease next to lung cancer in human. Early detectionof breast cancer is accomplished by X-ray mammography. Mammography is the most effective and efficient techniqueused for detection of breast cancer in women and also to improve the breast cancer prognosis. The numbers of imagesneed to be examined by the radiologists, the resulting may be misdiagnosis due to human errors by visual Fatigue.In order to avoid human errors, Computer Aided Diagnosis is implemented. In Computer Aided Diagnosis system,number of processing and analysis of an image is done by the suitable algorithm. Methods: This paper proposed atechnique to aid radiologist to diagnosis breast cancer using Shearlet transform image enhancement method. Similar towavelet filter, Shearlet coefficients are more directional sensitive than wavelet filters which helps detecting the cancercells particularly for small contours. After enhancement of an image, segmentation algorithm is applied to identify thesuspicious region. Result: Many features are extracted and utilized to classify the mammographic images into harmfulor harmless tissues using neural network classifier. Conclusions: Multi-scale Shearlet transform because more details ondata phase, directionality and shift invariance than wavelet based transforms. The proposed Shearlet transform gives multiresolution result and generate malign and benign classification more accurate up to 93.45% utilizing DDSM database.
