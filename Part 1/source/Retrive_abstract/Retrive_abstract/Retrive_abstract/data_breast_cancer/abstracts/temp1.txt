Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (breast-ACC) is a rare tumor with a favorable prognosis, despite its triple-negative status and special type of basal-like tumor for which scant population-based descriptive data exist. We sought to provide new population-based information on breast-ACC in India. Due to the paucity of the number of cases, the natural history of the disease is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to examine the clinico-pathological characteristics of the disease and to evaluate the outcome of surgical intervention in a tertiary referral care centre.
