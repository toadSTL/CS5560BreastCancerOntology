The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has drastically increased over the past decades. Because DCIS is resected after diagnosis similarÂ to invasive breast cancer, the natural cause and behaviour of DCIS is not well known. We aimed to determine breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) according to grade in DCIS patients after surgical treatment in the Netherlands.
