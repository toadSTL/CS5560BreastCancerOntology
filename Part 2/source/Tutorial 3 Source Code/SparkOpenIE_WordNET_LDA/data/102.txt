Breast cancer is recognized as a heterogeneous cancer in female patients worldwide. The discovery of a new biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis is urgently needed. According to our preliminary molecular biology experiment data, we discovered that the membrane type mannose receptor (MR) was highly expressed in breast cancer patients serum, and not detected in normal human serum. Because membrane type MR was differentially expressed in four types of breast cancer, we assume that membrane type MR could be used to distinguish four types of breast cancer. Therefore, we systematically analyzed the glycosylation of membrane type MR by mass spectrometry. Six glycosylation sites were identified, among them five were newly identified in this study. A barcode mode was established based on these six glycosylation sites. Based on the barcode mode, four types of breast cancer could be easily distinguished by using the barcode mode. Interestingly, the Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), which is usually difficult to identify, can be clearly distinguished from the other subtypes of breast cancer through this barcode mode.
