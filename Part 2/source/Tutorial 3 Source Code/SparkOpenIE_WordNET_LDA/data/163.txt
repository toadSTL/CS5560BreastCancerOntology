Breast cancer is still a serious health problem in 21st century and diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this malignant disease are subject to many research. While cancer research has been focused on tumour cells primarily, recent studies showed that tumour stroma contribute to carcinogenesis as well as tumour cells. Especially fibroblasts adjacent to epithelial tumour cells are not ordinary fibroblasts and play the critical role. Studies showed that these cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have different genetic profile and protein expression. One of the differently expressed molecules recently found is podoplanin. Podoplanin, utilised as a lymphatic endothelial marker, is found to be expressed in CAFs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the stromal expression of podoplanin in invasive breast carcinoma and clinicopathological parameters.
