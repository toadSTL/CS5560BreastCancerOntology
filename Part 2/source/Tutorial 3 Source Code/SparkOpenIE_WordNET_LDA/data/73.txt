In Belgium, breast cancer is the most frequent women's cancer accounting for to 35.3 % of the cases. In 2013, 10,778 newly diagnosed breast cancers have been reported in Belgium. Breast cancer has a relatively good prognosis with a 5 year overall survival of 88 %. Survival will be different regarding the subtype and stage at diagnosis. The review of the literature and the guidelines from ESMO and ASCO regarding the follow-up of patients with early breast cancer will be used as references. International guidelines recommend clinical visits (frequencies depending of the subtypes of breast cancer) with an annual mammography associated with an echography. MRI Imaging should be performed in " at risk " patients. A more extensive exploration should be proceede when a relapse is suspected during follow up. Indeed, studies have shown that intensive follow- up with several additional exams detect more recurrences without any impact on overall survival and lead to anxiety. The follow-up of patients treated for breast cancer has several objectives : - Detect a local recurrence or a second tumor ; - Diagnosis of a distant relapse ; - Detect side effects of treatment ; - Psycho-social impact of the disease and improve the quality of life.
