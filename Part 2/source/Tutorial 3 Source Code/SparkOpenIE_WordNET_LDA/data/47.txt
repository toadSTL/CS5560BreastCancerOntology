Compared with other subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is seriously threatening to human life. Therefore, it is a matter of urgency to develop multifunctional nanoprobes for visualized theranostics of TNBC, achieving specific targeting toward only TNBC, but not other subtypes. Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show important potential in visualized theranostics of tumors, but it is critical to synthesize well-defined core-shell MOF-based nanocomposites by encapsulating a single nanoparticle within MOF. In this study, a TNBC-targeted peptide (ZD2)-engineered, and a single gold nanostar (AuNS) coated within MIL-101-NH
