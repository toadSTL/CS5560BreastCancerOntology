Use of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is a standard method for evaluation of proposed prognostic and predictive tumour markers. However, little is known of the preservation of biomarker expression in old FFPE tumour blocks. We investigate the quality of immunohistochemical (IHC) oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) evaluation in FFPE tissue over time (1978-2000) using a large breast cancer tissue microarray (N = 573) with access to receptor analyses in cytosol (CYT) at diagnosis, coexpression of other biomarkers and follow-up data. We found a good correlation between ER analysed with CYT at diagnosis and ER analysed with IHC in archived FFPE tissue from the same tumour. ER evaluation did not seem to be affected by tissue storage time. Nor was there any time-dependent difference in ER
