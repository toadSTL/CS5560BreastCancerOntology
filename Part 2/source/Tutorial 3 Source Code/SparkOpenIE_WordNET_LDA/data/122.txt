Higher-quality imaging, refined surgical procedures, enhanced pathologic evaluation, and improved understanding of the impact of tumor biology on treatment and prognosis have necessitated revisions of the AJCC breast cancer staging system. The eighth edition includes clinical and pathologic prognostic stages that incorporate biologic variables-grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, HER2 status, and multigene panels-with the anatomic extent of disease defined by tumor, node, and metastasis categories. The prognostic staging systems facilitate more refined stratification with respect to survival than anatomic stage alone. Because the prognostic staging systems are dependent on biologic factors, accuracy is dependent on rigorous pathologic evaluation of tumors and on administration of treatment dictated by tumor biology. It is anticipated that technological advances will facilitate even more refined determination of underlying biology within tumors and in the peripheral blood, which increasingly is being evaluated as a compartment that reflects the primary tumor and sites of distant metastases. Diseases should be staged according to the eighth edition staging system to accurately reflect prognosis and to allow standardized data collection. Such standardization will facilitate assessment of the impact of advances in diagnosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer.
