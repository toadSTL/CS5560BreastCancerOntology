Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting > 1.6 million women each year, projected to increase to 2.2 million cases annually by 2025. A disproportionate number of the > 500,000 women who die as a result of breast cancer each year reside in low-resource settings. Breast cancer control is an important component of cancer control planning and women's health programs, and tools are needed across the care continuum to reduce the cancer burden, especially in low-resource settings. Cancer control planning is complex and multifaceted. Evidence shows that outcomes are improved when prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, and palliation are integrated and synchronously developed within a country/region's health plan. The Knowledge Summaries for Comprehensive Breast Cancer Control are the product of a multiyear collaboration led by the Union for International Cancer Control, Breast Health Global Initiative, Pan American Health Organization, and Center for Global Health of the US National Cancer Institute. Fourteen knowledge summaries distilled from evidence-based, resource-stratified guidelines, and aligned with WHO guidance on breast cancer control, build a framework for resource prioritization pathways and delivery systems for breast cancer control at four levels of available resources: basic, limited, enhanced, and maximal. Each summary contains relevant content to inform breast cancer policy, clinical care, and advocacy, aiding in the development and implementation of policies and programs. These tools provide a common platform for stakeholders, including policymakers, administrators, clinicians, and advocates to engage in decision making appropriate to their local setting. The goal is to facilitate evidence-based policy actions and urgently advance implementation of an integrated approach to reduce breast cancer mortality and improve quality of life.
