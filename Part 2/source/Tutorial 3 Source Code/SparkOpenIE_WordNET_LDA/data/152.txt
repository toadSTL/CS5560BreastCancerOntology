Breast cancer is a very complex and heterogeneous disease with variable molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and clinical behaviors. The identification of prognostic risk factors may enable effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. In particular, numerous gene-expression-based prognostic signatures were developed and some of them have already been applied into clinical trials and practice. In this study, we summarized several representative gene-expression-based signatures with significant prognostic value and separately assessed their ability of prognosis prediction in their originally targeted populations of breast cancer. Notably, many of the collected signatures were originally designed to predict the outcomes of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) patients or the whole breast cancer cohort; there are no typical signatures used for the prognostic prediction in a specific population of patients with the intrinsic subtype. We thus attempted to identify subtype-specific prognostic signatures via a computational framework for analyzing multi-omics profiles and patient survival. For both the discovery and an independent data set, we confirmed that subtype-specific signature is a strong and significant independent prognostic factor in the corresponding cohort. These results indicate that the subtype-specific prognostic signature has a much higher resolution in the risk stratification, which may lead to improved therapies and precision medicine for patients with breast cancer.
