VEGF family members are important factors in promoting angio- and lymphangiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate concentrations, diagnostic utility and power of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR-2 in comparison to CA15-3 in breast cancer (BC) patients. The study included 120 BC patients and 60 control patients (28 with benign breast tumors and 32 healthy women). Plasma levels of tested parameters were determined by ELISA, CA15-3 by CMIA. Concentrations of all parameters showed statistical significance when compared BC patients to controls. VEGF-D showed the highest SE (82.50%) in total BC group. Highest SP and PPV in total BC group showed VEGF-A(76.67%;84.78%,respectively), but lower than CA15-3. Highest NPV showed VEGF-C(52.33%), but it was lower than CA15-3. VEGF-C was also the best parameter which had statistically significant AUC in total cancer group (0.7672), but also stages I(0.7684) and II(0.7772). In the total group of BC almost all tested parameters showed statistically significant AUC, but a maximum range was obtained for the combination of VEGF-C + CA15-3(0.8476). The combined analysis of tested parameters and CA15-3 resulted in increase in SE and AUC values, which provides hope for developing a new panel of biomarkers that may be used in the diagnosis of BC in the future.
