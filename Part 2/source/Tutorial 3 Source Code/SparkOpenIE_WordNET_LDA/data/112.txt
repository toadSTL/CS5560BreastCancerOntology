Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and the obesity is one ofthe factors related to the risk of breast cancer mainly in postmenopausal women. This study investigated the associationbetween obesity in pre- and postmenopausal women with the development of breast cancer and the expression ofestrogen, progesterone, HeR-2 and triple-negative (TN) receptors. Methods: A case-control study was conductedon 100 patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer and 400 age-matched controls. The women were divided intopre- and post-menopausal groups. Results: The multivariate analysis showed that postmenopausal women witha BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 at pre-diagnosis and at the most recent measurement were 1.50 (95% CI 1.06-2.13) and 1.56(95% CI 1.11-2.21) times more likely to develop breast cancer, respectively. These women had a prevalence ofobesity of 27.7% when considering pre-diagnosis BMI and 29.4% when analyzing the indicator of recent BMI. Whenonly the cases regarding the presence of obesity with clinicopathological variables were analyzed, a total of 95.2% ofthe postmenopausal women with pre-diagnostic obesity according to BMI presented the positive estrogen receptor(ER) subtype. Conclusions: In Brazilian women, there is an association between obesity and the risk of breast cancerpostmenopause; moreover, there is an association between the occurrence of the positive ER subtype in postmenopausalwomen and pre-diagnostic obesity according to BMI.
