The most common sites of breast cancer metastasis are the bone, liver, lung and brain, while gastrointestinal metastasis from breast cancer is rare. We herein present the case of a 68-year-old woman who was admitted to our department with nausea and appetite loss. The patient's medical history included right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy 5 years earlier for invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 6.2 cm in greatest diameter, without lymphovascular invasion. Two years after the surgery, the patient developed brain metastasis and underwent metastasectomy to control the neurological symptoms, including unsteadiness and asthenia. After the second surgery, the patient received systemic chemotherapy using S-1, followed by bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. However, due to bevacizumab-related cardiotoxicity, the treatment was switched to eribulin. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, an elevated lesion was identified in the antrum, causing severe narrowing of the gastric outlet. Biopsy and histological examination of the tumor revealed infiltration of the gastric wall by undifferentiated neoplastic cells with poor adhesion, morphologically similar to invasive lobular carcinoma, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for estrogen receptor, mammaglobin and GATA3. Finally,
