The objective of the present study was to compare the differentiation between breast cancer and benign breast lesions and study regional distribution characteristics in various subtypes of breast cancer using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters. This retrospective study involved 119 patients with breast cancer and 22 patients with benign breast lesions, who underwent 3.0T breast magnetic resonance imaging examinations. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM parameters (slow ADC, fast ADC and fraction of fast ADC) were obtained from patients with breast cancer and benign lesions using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with b-values of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 500, 1,000 and 1,500 sec/mm
