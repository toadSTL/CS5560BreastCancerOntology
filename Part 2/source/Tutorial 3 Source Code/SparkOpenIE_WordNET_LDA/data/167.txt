Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. When treated by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, there are various non-pharmacological adjuvant therapies (NPATs) recommended for helping the patients with breast cancer alleviate multiple side effects induced by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and improve quality of life (QoL). However, the existing evidence does not suggest the therapy with the best effectiveness among a variety of NPATs. This study is to compare the effectiveness of different NPATs on QoL in the patients with breast cancer using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA).
