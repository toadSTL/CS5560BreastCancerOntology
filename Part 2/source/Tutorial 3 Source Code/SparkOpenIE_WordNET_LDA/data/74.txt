A better understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis would contribute to improved diagnosis and therapy and potentially decreased mortality rates. Here, we found that the MORC family CW-type zinc finger 4 (MORC4) overexpression in breast cancer tissues is associated with poor survival, and the short-interfering RNA knockdown of MORC4 suppresses the growth of breast cancer cells by promoting apoptosis. To investigate the mechanisms associated with MORC4 upregulation, microRNAs potentially targeting MORC4 were analyzed, with miR-193b-3p identified as the regulator and a negative correlation between miR-193b-3p and MORC4 expression determined in both breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Further analysis verified that MORC4 silencing did not affect miR-193b-3p expression, although altered miR-193b-3p expression attenuated MORC4 protein levels. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assays verified miR-193b-3p binding to the 3' untranslated region of MORC4. Furthermore, restoration of miR-193b-3p expression in breast cancer cells led to decreased growth and activation of apoptosis, which was consistent with results associated with MORC4 silencing in breast cancer cells. These results identified MORC4 as differentially expressed in breast cancer cells and tissues and its downregulation by miR-193b-3p, as well as its roles in regulating the growth of breast cancer cells via regulation of apoptosis. Our findings offer novel insights into potential mechanisms associated with breast cancer pathogenesis.
