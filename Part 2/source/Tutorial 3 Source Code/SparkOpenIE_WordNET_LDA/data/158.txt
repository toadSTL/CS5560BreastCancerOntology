Anthracycline chemotherapy agents are commonly used to treat breast cancer, but also result in cardiac injury, and potentially detrimental effects to vascular and skeletal muscle. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that exercise and caloric restriction can independently reduce anthracycline-related injury to the heart as well as cancer progression, and may be promising short-term strategies prior to treatment administration. For women with breast cancer, a short-term strategy may be more feasible and appealing, as maintaining regular exercise training or a diet throughout chemotherapy can be challenging due to treatment symptoms and psychosocial distress.
