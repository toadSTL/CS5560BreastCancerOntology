Breast cancer is a malignant disease that represents an important public health burden. The description of new molecular markers can be important to diagnosis, classification, and treatment. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) polymodal channel is expressed in different neoplastic tissues and cell lines of breast cancer and associated with the regulation of tumor growth, tumor neurogenesis, cancer pain, and malignant progression of cancer. In primary and metastatic breast cancer tumors, TRPV1 is expressed during neoplastic transformation, invasive behavior, and resistance to cytotoxic therapy.
